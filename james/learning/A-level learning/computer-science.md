### Section 1 - Components of a computer

Control Unit - Controls and coordinates CPU activity. Decodes and executes and stores result in memory.
Buses - Parallel wires connecting computer components. Usually 8, 16, 32 or 64 lines. Transmission medium.
Address bus - For when CPU wants to access a specific memory location.
Data bus - Returns data from address bus location to CPU
Control bus - Sends control signals. Bi-directional and ensures data and address bus dont conflict.
System bus - The three buses collectively connecting with a processor, I/O controller and memory.
Word - Fixed size of digits handled as a unit by a processor. Different processors have different word sizes.
Registers - Special memory cells operating at high speed. Store results of operations.
Accumulator(ACC) - Stores result of all calculations made by ALU.
Current Instruction register(CIR) -  Holds current instruction being executed, split into operand and opcode.
Memory Data Register (MDR) - Temporarily stores data read/written to memory.
Opcode - To determine the type of instruction and the hardware to execute it.
Operand - Holds either address of data, the actual data or the data to be operated on passed to ALU/ACC.
Clock - Switches between 1 and 0 millions of times per second generating signals.
Cache - Small, expensive, fast memory inside CPU. Instruction is copied to this.
Pipelining - Allows next instruction to be fetched whilst previous is being decoded to improve speed.
