### Section 1 - Components of a computer
Address bus - For when CPU wants to access a specific memory location, gets the memory's address.
Data bus - Transmits data in memory between processor components and memory.
Control bus - Sends control signals. Bi-directional and ensures data and address bus dont conflict.
System bus - The three buses collectively connecting with a processor, I/O controller and memory.

Registers - Special memory cells operating at high speed. Store results of operations.
Accumulator(ACC) - Stores result of all calculations made by ALU.
Current Instruction register(CIR) -  Holds current instruction being executed, split into operand and opcode.
Memory Data Register (MDR) - Temporarily stores data read/written to memory.
Opcode - To determine the type of instruction and the hardware to execute it.
Operand - Holds either address of data, the actual data or the data to be operated on passed to ALU/ACC.
Clock - Switches between 1 and 0 millions of times per second generating signals.
Cache - Small, expensive, fast memory inside CPU. Instruction is copied to this.

Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC) - Large sets using few lines of assembly code. Loads data into a separate register to perform function then stores it back into the original memory.
CISC Disadvantages - Many specialised instructions had to be built into hardware but only 20% were used.
CISC Advantages - Compiler has little work. Very little RAM required to store instructions.
Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC) - Only simple instructions that take one clock cycle can be executed.
RISC Disadvantages - Compiler has to do more work. More RAM required to store instructions.
