### Section 1 - The Economic Problem
Four factors of Production - Labour, Capital, Enterprisea and Land
Product Posibility Frontiers (PPF) - Show maximum output of available options
Free market - Allocates resources based on supply and demand and price mechanism
Command economy - Government decives how resources should be allocated.


### Section 2 - Competitive Markets
Demand - Quantity of something consumers are willing to pay a price for at a particular time.
Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) - How the quantity demanded responds to its change in price.
Income Elasticity of Demand (YED) - How demand changes with change in real income
YED formula - % change in quantity demanded / % change in real income
Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED) - How quantity demanded responds to another goods change in price.
Joint Supply - Production of something involves the production of another thing.
Market equilibrium - Supply = Demand

### Section 3 - Business Economics
Specialisation - Leads to division of labour as different workers have different skills
Marginal cost - Extra cost from producing the final unit of output. Cost of 'one more unit'
Law of Diminishing returns - If one variable facotr is increased while others stay fixed, marginal returns will begin to decrease
Average product - Output produced per unit of factor input
Demerger - Breaking up of a firm into separate firms, so each one can focus on a specific market.

### Section 4 - Market Structures
Price descrimination - Charging different prices to different customers for the same product. Three stages
Oligopoly - Market thats dominated by a few interdependent firms, competing intensely



### Section 5 - Market failure
Merit Goods - Benefit society more than private benefits
Demerit Goods - Opposite of merit goods
Symmetric information - Everyone has same knowledge in the market (seller and buyer)



### Section 6 - Government Issues
Price controls - Government can set a min./max. price for a good or service.
Competition Polity - Governments try to avoid monopolies forming in markets
Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) - Insurance to repay debt if borrower is unable to do so.
Government Intervention - Governments putting in regulations or helping consumer decisions
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) - Helps farmers by collecting market failure from fluctuating prices. Failed.



### Section 7 - The Labour Market
Monopsony - Only one buyer in a market.
Trade union - Organisation to represent the interests of a group of workers. Usually to bargain with employers
Wage discrimination - Price discrimination but with wages, workers usually paid by job/willingness to work.
Incentives - Given to people to encourage them to work.
Demographic changes - Changes in the features of a population (age, lifestyle, gender)


### Section 8 - Measuring Economic Performance
Four Macroeconomic indicators - Rate of economic growth, inflation, unemployment, balance of payments
Inflation - Sustained rise in average price of things over a time period or a fall in value of money.
Retail Price Index (RPI) - Measure for inflation, what people spend their money on
Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Measure for inflation, similar to RPI but excludes things like council tax.


### Section 9 - Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply
Aggregate Demand - Total spending on goods and services
AD formula - Consumption + Investment + Government spending + (Exports - Imports)
Aggregate Supply - Total output produced in an economy.
Macroeconomic Equilibrium - AS = AD

### Section 10 - Government Economic Policy objectives
Full employment - Everyone of working age who wants to work has a job.
Structural unemployment - From a decline in certain industries, usually from a change in consumer interests.
Frictional unemployment - Unemployment from leaving one job and finding another, the time it takes.
Real wage unemployment - Real wages being pushed above equal level of employment
Balance of Payments (BOP) - Records all flows of money in/out of a country
Natural rate of unemployment (NRU) - Rate of unemployment when labour market is in equilibrium
Lorenz curves - Graphically represent the distribution of income
Equity - Being fair, different people have different circumstances. People get what they need
Relative poverty - Having low income in comparison to others income.
Absolute poverty - Unable to access/buy basic needs (food, shelter)

### Section 11 - Macroeconomic Policy Instruments
Fiscal policy - Involves government spending and taxation.
Cyclical budget position - Governments short-term fiscal stance.
Structural budget position - Governments long-term fiscal stance.
Monetary policy - Involves making decisions about interest, money supply and exchange rates. Affects AD.
Supply-side policies - To increase the economy's trend growth rate/productive potential.

### Section 12 - The Financial Sector
Money Markets - For short term finance
Capital Markets - Medium and Long-term finance by issuing bonds and shares.
Foreign Exchange markets - For international trade and investment.
Market bubbles - Process in a market are greater than the assets.
