### Section 1 - The Economic Problem
Four factors of Production - Labour, Capital, Enterprisea and Land
Product Posibility Frontiers (PPF) - Show maximum output of available options
Free market - Allocates resources based on supply and demand and price mechanism
Command economy - Government decives how resources should be allocated.


### Section 2 - Competitive Markets
Demand - Quantity of something consumers are willing to pay a price for at a particular time.
Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) - How the quantity demanded responds to its change in price.
Income Elasticity of Demand (YED) - How demand changes with change in real income
YED formula - % change in quantity demanded / % change in real income
Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED) - How quantity demanded responds to another goods change in price.
Joint Supply - Production of something involves the production of another thing.
Market equilibrium - Supply = Demand

### Section 3 - Business Economics
Specialisation - Leads to division of labour as different workers have different skills
Marginal cost - Extra cost from producing the final unit of output. Cost of 'one more unit'
Law of Diminishing returns - If one variable facotr is increased while others stay fixed, marginal returns will begin to decrease
Average product - Output produced per unit of factor input
Demerger - Breaking up of a firm into separate firms, so each one can focus on a specific market.

### Section 4 - Market Structures
Price descrimination - Charging different prices to different customers for the same product. Three stages
Oligopoly - Market thats dominated by a few interdependent firms, competing intensely

Merit Goods - Benefit society more than private benefits
Demerit Goods - Opposite of merit goods
Symmetric information - Everyone has same knowledge in the market (seller and buyer)
