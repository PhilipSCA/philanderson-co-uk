Epithelial tissue - Lines surface of organs and blood vessels
Muscular tissue -  Contracts to get force/motion
Epidermal tissue - Human skin and waxy plant covering
Mesophyll - For photosynthesis
Glandular tissue - Digestive juices for breaking down.
Large intestine - Absorbs water from undigested food to make faeces
Small intestine - Digests food and absorbs soluble
Liver - Produces bile and stores glycogen
Glands - Produce digestive enzymes
Stomach - Digests food
Organism - Contains mulitple organ systems
Enzymes - Speed up reactions
Active site - Where specific substrate binds to speed up reaction
Denatured - Enzyme structure changes and doesnt work
Enzyme rate of reaction speed - Affected by temperature and pH
Tobacco Mosaic Virus - Reduces photosynthesis
Rose black spot - Reduces photosynthesis
Pathogens - Microorganisms causing disease, spread by air, contact and water
Communicable disease - Infectious
Non-communicable disease - Cant spread
Malaria - Mosquito (Vector) bites
Nose - Have hair and mucus to stop pathogens
Trachea and bronchi - Cilia and mucus
Immune system - White blood cells fight pathogens
Phagocytosis - White blood cells engulf pathogens
Antibodies - Produced to destroy microbes, attaches to antigens
Antitoxins - Chemicals to cancel out toxins from bacteria
Agrobacterium tumefacians - Bacterium infects plants
Antigen - Sticks out of pathogens
Eukaryotes - Have a nucleus
Parasites - Transferred by vectors, live on/in organisms
Hyphae - Grow and penetrate skin and plants, produce spores
Cholera - Bacterial, contaminated water
Encephalitis - Brain infection
Pneumonia - Lung infection
Antiretrovial drugs - Treatment for HIV
