## random terms

```
White blood cells - Defence system from pathogens
Plasma - Transports red/white blood cells, urea from liver -> kidneys, nutrients to cells
Epithelial tissue - Lines surface of organs and blood vessels
Muscular tissue -  Contracts to get force/motion
Epidermal tissue - Human skin and waxy plant covering
Mesophyll - For photosynthesis
Glandular tissue - Digestive juices for breaking down.
Large intestine - Absorbs water from undigested food to make faeces
Small intestine - Digests food and absorbs soluble
Liver - Produces bile and stores glycogen
Glands - Produce digestive enzymes
Stomach - Digests food
Organism - Contains mulitple organ systems
Enzymes - Speed up reactions
Active site - Where specific substrate binds to speed up reaction
Denatured - Enzyme structure changes and doesnt work
Enzyme rate of reaction speed - Affected by temperature and pH
Pathogens - Microorganisms causing disease, spread by air, contact and water
Communicable disease - Infectious
Non-communicable disease - Cant spread
Malaria - Mosquito (Vector) bites
Nose - Have hair and mucus to stop pathogens
Trachea and bronchi - Cilia and mucus secreted
Immune system - White blood cells fight pathogens
Phagocytosis - White blood cells engulf pathogens
Antibodies - Produced to destroy microbes, attaches to antigens
Antitoxins - Chemicals to cancel out toxins from bacteria
Agrobacterium tumefacians - Bacterium infects plants
Eukaryotes - Have a nucleus
Parasites - Transferred by vectors, live on/in organisms
Hyphae - Grow and penetrate skin and plants, produce spores
Cholera - Bacterial, contaminated water
Encephalitis - Brain infection
Pneumonia - Lung infection
Antiretrovial drugs - Treatment for HIV
Fungicides - Treats Rose Black Spot
Spores - Can be spread, fungal infection
Insecticides - Protection from mosquitos
Penicillin - Used to be an antibiotic for gonorrhoea
Bile - Breaks up fats into tiny droplets, called emulsification.
Amylase - Protein enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates(starch)
Protease - Enzyme, breaks protein peptide bonds into amino acids
Lipase - Enzymes that break down fats into glycerol/fatty acids
```
### B1: Cell Biology
```
Vacuole - Plant, cell sap
Cell wall - Supports cell
Chloroplasts - Chlorophyll to capture sunlight
Cytoplasm - Chemical reactions take place here
Mitochondria - Where respiration occurs for energy
Partially permeable membrane - Only allows water/small molecules to pass through.
Red blood cells - Carries oxygen, biconcave disk, haemoglobin.
Nucleus - Brain, controls the cell
Cell membrane - Animal, Controls what goes in and out of cell.
Ribosomes - Protein
MRS GREN - Movement, Respiration, Senses, Growth, Reproduction, Excretion, Nutrition. (7 Life processes)
Guard cell - Open/close stomata on a plant
Root hair cell - Plants,Collect water and minerals from soil to stem
Sperm cell - Animal, Fertilises an egg by breaking shell. Has a tail to swim 
Nerve cell - Animal, Send electrical impulses to brain for senses to work.
Skin cell - Animal, epidermis, makes up skin
Palisade cell - Plant, for photosynthesis.
Muscle cell - Animal, makes muscles for contracting
Prokaryotic cell - Bacterial cell, no nucleus, smaller, no mitochondria/chloroplasts and has plasmids
Plasmids - Small circular DNA circle in bacteria, each one distinct and give bacteria benefits such as antibiotic resistance
Eukaryotic cell - Plant, animal and fungal cells, have a nucleus, are larger than prokaryotic
Chromosomal DNA - In bacteria cells DNA is found as one circular chromosome, not a nucleus

```

### B4: The Heart and circulatory system
```
Arteries - Thick muscle walls, elastic fibres. AWAY from heart.
Capillaries - Exchange food and oxygen and waste. Arteries branch into these. Very thin
Veins - Thinner walls (low pressure), wider lumen, have valves. TO heart
Valves - Prevent backflow of blood
Pacemaker - Group of cells in the right atrium
Coronary arteries - Supply oxygen to heart muscle.
Double circulatory system - Blood goes to hea rt, then lungs, back to heart, to body organs.
Trachea - Throat, air goes to lungs through this
Bronchi - Tubes divided off trachea
Bronchioles - Divided off the bronchi and have alveoli at the end
Alveoli - Gas exchange here, Surrounded by capillaries for diffusion of COÂ² and oxygen to happen.
Platelets - Trigger blood clotting, no nucleus
```

###  B6: Preventing and Treating disease (_05/01/24_)
```
Vectors - Organisms that spread disease (Mosquito)
Salmonella - Bacterial infection from raw food
Gonorrhoea - STD, Bacteria, symptons = diarrhoea, green/yellow discharge etc
Measles - Red spots, Viral disease spread easily
HIV - STD, Viral disease.
TMV - Tobacco Mosaic Virus, for plants reducing photosynthesis
Rose black spot - Fungal disease on plants reducing photosynthesis
Skin - Has antimicrobial substances to kill pathogens
Cilia - Hair in nose and throat
Mucus - Traps particles that could be pathogenic
Hydrochloric acid - Stomach acid, kills pathogens
Lymphocytes - Antibodies WBC's make for defence
Vaccination - Inject weak pathogens for WBC's to recognise in future.
Epidemic - Outbreak of disease.
Painkillers - Relieve pain
Antibiotics - Kill specific bacteria
White Blood Cells - Can change shape and have a nucleus, defence system.
Aspirin - Painkiller for fever. Found in willow. (Drug)
Digitalis - Treats heart conditions. Found in foxgloves. (Drug)
Drug testing - Tested on cells/tissues first, then animals, then volunteers
Efficacy - Whether the drug works
Optimum dose - Most efficient dosage and few side effects
Placebo - Patient takes ineffective drug thinking its real
Toxicity - How harmful a drug is.
```
**_06/02/24_ - B6**
```
Vaccine - Has dead/inactive pathogens inserted into body via syringe, to trigger immune system so the WBC's remember those specific pathogens for the future, responding to them quicker.
Antigen - Sticks out a pathogen, where antibodies attach to destroy it.
Relieving symptoms drugs - Aspirin, Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Nurofen
Killing bacteria drugs - Penicillin, Methicillin 
Viruses - Reproduce rapidly inside host cells, bursting them.
Drug development - Consider 4 different things and need to be tested.
Effective? - Can the drug treat the disease?
Safe? - Is there unwanted harmful effects?
Uptake and removal? - Does the body consume and get rid of it?
Stable? - Can it be stored for a long time period?
Herd immunity - Large % of population is vaccinated so less spread of disease.
Resistant bacteria - Mutated bacteria that can't be killed by antibiotics easily.
MRSA - Resistant to methicillin, serious disease
Reducing resistant bacteria - Avoid over-prescribing antibiotics and finish full course of antibiotics
Plants immune system - Produce chemicals in each cell to depend from pathogens/pests
Preclinical testing (Step 1) - Tested on human cells/tissues first.
Live animal testing (Step 2) - On animals to find efficacy, toxicity, and dosage.
Clinical trial (Step 3) - Tested on healthy human volunteers. Optimum dosage found. Placebo test is used. Double blind test used.
Placebo test - One patient is given actual drug, other is given fake drug and neither know whether it's real or not.
Placebo effect - Patient believes treatment to work and feels better even if its fake, its in the mind.
Double blind trial - Patient nor doctor know whether drug is real so doctors aren't influenced by their knowledge without realising
