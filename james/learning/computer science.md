## random terms

```
Function - Subroutine that processes and returns a value
Procedure - Processes but doesnt return a value
Logic error - Doesn't execute as expected
Terminator - Start/End
Boolean conditions - AND, OR, NOT
.append - Add to end of a list
.remove - Remove from list
.insert - Insert into a list
Machine language - Binary for CPU to understand
Assembly language - Slightly easier to read than machine code
Compiler - HLL to machine code, all at once. Needed once and returns an error list
Interpreter - HLL to machine code, one line at a time, needed everytime, debugging
Caeser Cipher - Encrypts messages
ASCII - 128 character set, first encoding system
Robust - Doesn't crash
Assembler - Assembly code -> Machine code
Quotient - Division, full num
Constant - Value that can't change
Database - Data to fields and records
SQL - Insert, delete, update, select and merge data
High level language - More readable code, translated into machine code to run
Low level language - Machine and assembly code, harder to understand/write
Grace Hopper - Invented compilers
LAN - Covers a small geographical area on a single site.
WAN - Connects multiple LAN's over a large area, more expensive
Bandwidth - Amount of data trasnferred in a time period (Mbps)
Wired connection - Faster, more reliable
NIC - Allows devices to connect to a network
Switches - Connects devices on a LAN. Receives data and transmitts.
Router - Transmit data (packets) between networks. Used to connect to internet. 
Ethernet cables - Connect devices in a LAN to internet. (Cat 5e, CAT 6)
Coaxial cables - Single copper wire covered by plastic
Fibre optic cables - High performance, transmit large distances, no interference
Wireless network - Uses radio waves to transmit data
Wi-Fi - 2.4GHz or 5GHz. Wireless network
2.4GHz Wi-fi - Further range, better penetration
5GHz - Faster and less interference from other devices
Client-server networks - Network managed by a server
Servers - Files, software and data are stored here
Clients - Send requests to the server for info.
Peer-to-Peer network - Equal devices store individual data.
Topology - Layout of a network
Star topology - Devices connected to central server/switch
Bus topology - Devices in a line, connected to a backbone cable
Ring topology - Data moves in one direction. One device at a time
Mesh topology - Devices all connected to every other device
Partial mesh topology - Some devices aren't connected to others.
Network - Interconnected devices that exchange data.
Decode - Convert code -> English
Subroutine - Instruction to use another program for a task

Magnetic tapes - For archiving. Very high capacity, cheap, quite slow.
Bitmaps images - Stored as series of pixels
Colour depth - Number of bits per pixel
Number of Colours - 2^n (n = colour depth)
File size (image) - Resolution x Colour depth
Metadata - Information in an image so computer can recreate it.
Sound - Recorded by microphone as analogue signal.
Analogue signal - Continually changing data, converted to digital.
Sampling - Converting analogue to digital
Sample rate - Amount of samples per second (Hz)
Bit depth - Bits available per second
File size (sound) - Sample rate * Bit depth * duration(s)
Data compression - Make files smaller and keep main data.
Lossy compression - Removes data permanently
Lossless compression - Removes data temporarily then restores it upon opening.
Operating Systems (OS) - Manage hardware, run software
User Interface - User can interact with computer systems.
Device driver - Lets OS and hardware communicate
Graphical User Interface (GUI) - Everyday uses, visual and interactive.
Command-line Interface - Text based, source code for commands and scripts.
File management - OS organises data into hierarchial structure
Single User OS - Allows one user to use computer at once
Multi user OS - Several users use computers at the same time.
Defragmentation - Put broken up files together
Compression software - Makes files smaller, reduces size.
Encryption software - Protects files from interception.
Character sets - Character collections with binary representation.
Unicode - All characters/symbol. Multiple bytes per char.
File size (bits) - Num of bits per character x Num of characters
Decomposition - Breaking down a problem into smaller problems
Abstraction - Extracting key information only
Algorithms - Sets of instructions to complete a task
Algorithmic thinking - Methods to solve multiple similar problems
Psuedocode - For writing algorithms, readable, similar to programming languages.
Indentation - Makes code more readable
Flowchart - For writing algorithms, shapes and arrows
Start/Stop - Oval, start and end of program
Input/Output - Parallelogram, any inputs from user and outputs
Processes - Rectangle, instructions, processes and calculations
Decision - Diamond, often 'yes' or 'no'
Arrows - Show direction of algorithm
Sequence flowchart - Only one way to the end. No decisions
Selection flowchart - If statements/decisions, multiple ways to end
Iteration flowchart - Contains a loop on a task.
Binary search - Search algorithm, ordered list start from middle and half list
Linear search - Search algorithm, checks each item one by one until found.
