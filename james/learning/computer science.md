## random terms

```
Function - Subroutine that processes and returns a value
Procedure - Processes but doesnt return a value
Logic error - Doesn't execute as expected
Terminator - Start/End
Boolean conditions - AND, OR, NOT
.append - Add to end of a list
.remove - Remove from list
.insert - Insert into a list
Machine language - Binary for CPU to understand
Assembly language - Slightly easier to read than machine code
Compiler - HLL to machine code, all at once. Needed once and returns an error list
Interpreter - HLL to machine code, one line at a time, needed everytime, debugging
Caeser Cipher - Encrypts messages
ASCII - 128 character set, first encoding system
Robust - Doesn't crash
Assemlber - Assembly code -> Machine code
Quotient - Division, full num
Constant - Value that can't change
Database - Data to fields and records
SQL - Insert, delete, update, select and merge data
High level language - More readable code, translated into machine code to run
Low level language - Machine and assembly code, harder to understand/write
Grace Hopper - Invented compilers
LAN - Covers a small geographical area on a single site.
WAN - Connects multiple LAN's over a large area, more expensive
Bandwidth - Amount of data trasnferred in a time period (Mbps)
Wired connection - Faster, more reliable
NIC - Allows devices to connect to a network
Switches - Connects devices on a LAN. Receives data and transmitts.
Router - Transmit data between networks. Used to connect to internet
Ethernet cables - Connect devices in a LAN to internet. (Cat 5e, CAT 6)
Coaxial cables - Single copper wire covered by plastic
Fibre optic cables - High performance, transmit large distances, no interference
Wireless network - Uses radio waves to transmit data
Wi-Fi - 2.4GHz or 5GHz. Wireless network
2.4GHz Wi-fi - Further range, better penetration
5GHz - Faster and less interference from other devices
Client-server networks - Network managed by a server
Servers - Files, software and data are stored here
Clients - Send requests to the server for info.
Peer-to-Peer network - Equal devices store individual data.
Topology - Layout of a network
Star topology - Devices connected to central server/switch
Bus topology - Devices in a line, connected to a backbone cable
Ring topology - Data moves in one direction. One device at a time
Mesh topology - Devices all connected to every other device
Partial mesh topology - Some devices aren't connected to others.
Network - Interconnected devices that exchange data.
Decode - Convert code -> English
Subroutine - Instruction to use another program for a task
