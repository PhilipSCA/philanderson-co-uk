Atmospheric pressure - Average air pressure at sea level, measurement
Alternating current (AC) - Flow of current changes at intervals. Found in mains
Direct currect (DC) - Flow of charge goes in one direction and is steady. Found in batteries
Step up transformer - Increases voltage, decreases current
Step down transformer - Decreases voltage, increases current

Eureka can - Used to measure volume of a solid
Specific latent heat - Energy requried to change 1kg mass into a different state (liquid or gas)
Specific latent heat of fusion - For changing between a solid and liquid (melting/freezing)
Specific latent heat of vaporisation - For changing between a liquid and gas (evaporating/condensing)
Colliding - Gas particles create pressure with collision
Niels Bohr - Developed current model of atom, discovered shells of electrons
Alpha particles - Helium nuclei, two protons and two neutrons, strongly ionising

Nebula - Cloud of dust and gas
Protostar - Gravity pulls the dust and gas together
Hydrogen nuclei - Undergoes nuclear fusion
Nuclear fusion - Two nuclei react and fuse
Nuclear fission - Neutron collides with an atom and splits it, releasing energy, chain reaction.
Main sequence star - Stable period for billions of years where outward pressure expands star and balances gravity pulling inwards.
Red giant - Hydrogen runs out and small star swells. Cools down.
Red Super giant - Hydrogen runs out, larger star swells. Heavier elements at core
White dwarf - Unstable star ejects outer layer of dust/gas, just core is left
Black dwarf - White dwark cools and cant emit enough energy.
Supernova - Red Super Giant undergoes more fusion, heavy element explode into this.
Neutron star - Exploding supernova throws outer layer of dust/gas away, dense core left
Black hole - If star is big enough, super dense point in space forms.
Solar system - Sun orbited by 8 planets
Planets - Large objects that orbit a star. Large enough to have gravity
Dwarf planets - Orbit stars, dont meet rules to be a planet
Moons - Orbit planets, natural satellite
Artificial satellites - Man made satellites
Milkyway Galaxy - Collection of billions of stars held by gravity
Diode - Current only flows one way. Very high resistance in other direction
Resistor - Resistance stays constant. Current proportional to pd
Variable resistor - Resistance can be set by someone.
LED - Light Emitting Diode, Diode that gives off light
Lamp - Lights up when current flows to it. Resistance increases as temperature increases
Thermistor - Resistance depends on temperature. Resistance decreases as temperature increases
LDR - Resistance decreases as light intensity increases. Used in automatic lights
Cell/Battery - Provides p.d and energy for a circuit
Current (I) - Rate of flow of electric charge. (Amps)
Charge (Q) - Current x Time. Number of electrons. (Coulombs)
Potential difference (V) - Energy transferred per unit charge. The push on electrons (Volts)
Resistance (R) - Ability to slow current. P.d / Current. (Ohms)
Switch - When its closed, current flows through
Fuse - Resistor that melts if current is too high
Voltmeter - Measures p.d across a component
Ammeter - Measures current through a component
Series circuit - Current has one route and is the same all way round. Potential difference is shared and resistance is added
Parallel circuit - Current has multiple paths. Current is shared on branches. P.d is the same and total resistance is small
Energy transferred - Charge x voltage
UK mains - AC supply is 230V and frequency is 50Hz
National grid - System of cables and transformers to get people electricity
Time period = 1 / Frequency
Frequency - Number of times a second AC changes direction. (Hz)
Frequency formula - Cycle x (Time base x Cycle)
Electrical power formula - CurrentÂ² x Resistance
Static electricity - When charges are not free to move.
Static - Caused by friction. Negative electrons passed onto another surface
Sparks - From too much static, electron jump to earthed conductor
Polythene and Acetate rod - Example with cloth dustor showing static from friction
Static charge - Caused from electrons moving to another surface
Electric field - Around any electrically charged object.
