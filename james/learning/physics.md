## random terms

```
Power - Rate of energy transferred
Watt - Unit for power
Efficiency - % of energy is transferred usefully
Elastic - Return to original shape after force is removed
Deformation - Bending, stretching or compressing
Extension - Change in length of an object after force is applied
Spring constant - Proportion between the variables
Non-linear relationship - Curved line for graphs
Potential difference - Work done per coulomb of charge, difference in voltage at points in a circuit
Appliance - Device that transfers energy to other forms
Energy transfer - Some is wasted to surrounding, some is useful
Irradiation - Exposure to radiation
Ionisation - Add/Remove an electron
Cochlea - Small bone in ear
Geothermal energy - Heat from earths surface
Fission - Neutron collides into atom, splitting it and releasing energy
Gamma ray - Penetrating form of electromagnetic radiation, low ionisation
Becquerel - Unit for radiation
Refraction - Change in direction for waves
Specific heat capacity - Energy required to raise 1kg by 1 degree | Change in E = mc x change in temp
Oscilloscope - Tool for analysing waveform of signals
Terminal velocity - Max velocity
Inertia - Unchanged
Atmospheric pressure - Average air pressure at sea level, measurement
Alternating current (AC) - Flow of current switches at intervals
Direct currect (DC) - Flow of charge goes in one direction
Step up transformer - Increases voltage, decreases current
Step down transformer - Decreases voltage, increases current
Live wire - 230V, carries volts to mains in power supply, Brown
Neutral Wire - Completes circuit, connected to earth wire, blue
Earth wire - Carries current to ground for safety, green and yellow
Fuse - Electrical safety device if current overloads
Charge - Coulombs, current flow of particles
Pylons - Structures that support high voltage overhead power lines
Thermistor - Temperature resistor
Convection - Particles move from hotter to cooler regions
Vectors - Magnitude and direction
Scalars - Only magnitude, no specific direction
Moments - Turning effect of a force
Interaction pair - Pair of forces that equal and opposite on two objects
Eureka can - Used to measure volume of a solid
Specific latent heat - Energy requried to change 1kg mass into a different state (liquid or gas)
Specific latent heat of fusion - For changing between a solid and liquid (melting/freezing)
Specific latent heat of vaporisation - For changing between a liquid and gas (evaporating/condensing)
Colliding - Gas particles create pressure with collision
Niels Bohr - Developed current model of atom, discovered shells of electrons
Alpha particles - Helium nuclei, two protons and two neutrons, strongly ionising
Beta particles - High speed electrons
Gamma rays - Electromagnetic waves with short wavelength, far distance
Alpha decay - Decreases charge and mass of nucleus, atomic number reduced by 2 and mass number by 4
Beta decay - Increases charge of nucleus, neutron turns into proton and releases an electron
