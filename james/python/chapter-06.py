# Chapter 6: Unfamiliar math operators

# This operator gives you the remainder of the division (eg 3 for this):
modulo_remainder = 15 % 4
# When there is no remainder, its assigned 0

# Addition (this is 4):
age = 3
age = age + 1
# or 
age2 = 3 
age2 += 1

# It is the same as Addition for subtraction and multiplication just use -/* instead of +
# You can add variables

age3 = 5
amount_to_increment = 4
age3 += amount_to_increment # = 9
