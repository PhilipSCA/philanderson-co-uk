# Say you want to know whether the string assigned to drink is water
drink = "water"
if drink == "water":
    print("Yep, its water")
# If drink wasn't water then it wouldn't say "Yes, its water"
# First line has to end in a colon
# Two equal signs (==) and If doesnt work

# Numbers work the same
if 2 + 2 == 4:
    print("Simple Addition")

# Anything under the colon thats indented only executes if its true
