city_0 = "Atlanta"
city_1 = "Baltimore"
city_2 = "Chicago"
city_3 = "Denver"
city_4 = "Los Angeles"

# If i do
print("Welcome to " + city_2)
# Python will display: Welcome to Chicago

# Another type of variable is lists, it can have a sequence of values assigned to it.
# The values are known as 'elements'

cities = ["Atlanta", "Baltimore", "Chicago", "Denver", "Los Angeles"]
# cities is the variable
# When you are making a list, you enclose everything on the right in square brackets.

# Once you have made a list with a variable, you can refer to each element like this:
print(cities[0])
print(cities[1])
# cities[0] would be Atlanta
# cities[1] would be Baltimore
# The numbers start from 0, not 1, so 0 is the first element.
# You enclose the number in square brackets

# A list value can be any value you assign to ordinary variables

random_things = [2, "Bob", "Now is"]

# random_things[0] = 2 (Numerical value)
# random_things[1] = "Bob"
# random_things[2] = "Now is"
