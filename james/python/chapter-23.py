#   Input, converting strings, numbers

# Say we have a list of Englands five most populated cities
# To check if the city is on the list, ues pythons input function
city_to_check = input("Enter the name of a city: ")

# The name of the city entered by the user is assigned city_to_check

# If you want it to be a number so you can do math on it.
monthly_income = 2000
monthly_income_as_an_integer = int(monthly_income)
# int is short for integer (fyi)

# To convert a number to a float (a number with decimal places) use float:
monthly_income_as_a_float = float(monthly_income)

# To convert a number into a string for concatenation or other reasons:
min_wage2 = 750
min_wage = str(min_wage2)
