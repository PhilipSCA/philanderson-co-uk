#   Dictionaries: What they are

# Say you wanted to make a list but it was a bit more complicated
print ("Customer 155's first name: James")
print ("Customer 155's last name: Anderson")
print ("Customer 155's address: (random address)")
print ("Customer 155's city: London")
print ("Customer 155's country: England")

# When you are working with Customer 155's information, you want to be able to pick something out of the series.
# So you create a dictionary

# A dictionary works something like a list, but instead of a simple series of things, its a series of pairs(2).
# Each pair contains a key - (e.g "first name"), and a value - ("James")
