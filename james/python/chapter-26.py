#   Coding Dictionaries

# If we use the same example as the previous chapter (Customer 155), this is how we would make the dictionary.
# In a dictionary, its similar to a list but we use curly brackets, and each thing is paired key and value (colon)
customer_155 = {"first name": "James", "last name": "Anderson", "address": "2203 random address"}

# Also, the variable name is usually singular, not plural
# And everything, key and value, is in quotation marks

# This is basically a longer version of a dictionary:
first_name = "James"
last_name = "Anderson"
address = "2203 random address"
