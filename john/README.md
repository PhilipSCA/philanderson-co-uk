# chemistry

## general terms

Isotonic- when two compared things have equal types of molecules-------
Conservation of energy - energy can be transferred or stored but cannot be created or destroyed
Isomesmerisation - when one molecule changes into another
Electrostatic force - the force of attraction between two oppositely charged particles (electron and nucleus)
Covalent bond - bonding between non-metals
Ionic bond - bonding between a non-metal and a metal
Metallic bonding - bonding between metals
Dissipate - spread around
Adhesion - attraction or binding betweeen different molecules
Purification - extracting something from a substance
Insoluble - cannot be dissolved
Dessicate - to dry something
Soluble - able to be dissolved
Alkali - substance with a pH higher than 7.
Cation - positive ion
Anion - negative ion
Conductor - material that traps heat
Insulator - material that blocks heat.

# C1 - Atoms and Elements - Atomic structure

Atom - smallest thing that can exist - makes up elements
Molecule - A group of atoms chemically bonded
Mixture - two or more elements not chemically bonded
Isotope - element with different number of neutrons but same number of protons
Element - substance made up of one type of atom
Nucleus - Centre of atom, contains protons and neutrons
Compound - two or more atoms chemically bonded together
Chromatography - method used for separating dyes and ink in a mixture
Filtration - method to separate insoluble solids from liquids
Evaporation - one method to separate soluble solids from solutions, by heating solution
Crystallisation - another method to separate soluble solids from solutions, by heating then cooling (into crystals)
Simple distillation - to separate a liquid from another liquid, for a mixture with a big difference in boiling points
Fractional distillation - separates a mixture of liquids with similar boiling points.

### Atom discovery
John Dalton - 1803 - discovered atoms, described them as solid spheres, different spheres make diff elements
J.J Thompson - 1897 - discovered electrons, created 'Plum Pudding model'
Ernest Rutherford - 1909 - fired positively charged alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold, some deflected and some went backwards. Concluded nucleus in the center, electrons around - 'Nuclear model'
Niels Bohr - Realised electrons orbit in fixed shells, with a fixed energy and distance. (Otherwise atom would collapse)

# C2 - Periodic table

Alloy - mixture of two elements, where atleast one is a metal
Metals - found in left and middle, have few outer shell electrons, lose or share electrons to get a full outer shell, become positive. 
Metal PROPERTIES:
- strong but malleable
- good heat and electricity conductors
- high melting & boiling points
Non-metals - found in right and top, have more electrons on outer shell, react and gain or share electrons and become negative.
non-metal PROPERTIES:
- dull, brittle
- not always solid at room temp.
- don't conduct electricity
- lower density
Transition metals - middle of periodic table - properties:
- dense, strong, shiny conductors.
- often have more than one ion - Cu2+, Co3+
- Coloured
- make good catalysts in compounds
Alkali metals - Group 1 metals - soft, low density. Have 1 electron on outer shell, react with non-metals to form ionic compounds. Trend as you go DOWN group:
1) Increased reactivity - outer shell is further away from nucleus, weakening electrostatic forces, less energy required for it to be lost.
2) Lower melting & boiling points - same reason
3) Higher atomic mass
Halogens - Group 7 non-metals - coloured vapours - all come as diatomic molecules, covalently bonded. Can either covalently bond or ionic bond with metals. Trend as you go DOWN the group:
1) Less reactivity - harder to gain electron when outer shell electrons are further away from nucleus, less attraction
2) Higher melting & boiling points
3) Higher atomic mass
Noble gases - Group 0 - inert colourless gases - unreactive as they have full outer shell - monatomic gases, non-flammable. Trend as you go DOWN group:
1) Boiling point increases - number of electrons increase, greater intermolecular forces so more energy needed.

### discovery of periodic table
John Newlands - 1864 - ordered elements by atomic weight or R. atomic mass; noticed some patterns but table was incomplete.
Dimitri Mendelev - 1869 - ordered elements by atomic mass - put similar properties together - left gaps for undiscovered elements.
