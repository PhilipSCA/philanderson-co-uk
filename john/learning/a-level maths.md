Central tendency - mean, median, mode - centre of data
Median - if even,  average of 2 middle numbers - n/2, n/2 + 1
        - odd, n/2
Standard deviation - root of variance
Variance - how spread out data is from mean
Histogram
model simplification - reduce variables/parameters
refining a model - use real life data to predicted data, then improve
problem solving cycle - get problem, collect data, analyse, conclusion
survey - collecting info from a population, quicker & cheaper than census
population - whole group of every single thing
census - collecting info from every member of population - time,consuming, expensive, accurate
sample - selection from population
systematic sampling - select every 'nth' member from a list
stratified sampling - proportional selection from categories - random selection from each category
quota sampling - fixed selection from categories - NOT random 
opportunity sampling - selection convenient to sampler
simple random sampling
