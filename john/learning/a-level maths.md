central tendency - mean, median, mode - centre of data
median - if even = avg of n/2, n/2 + 1
        - if odd = m/2
Mean (grouped) = sum fx / sum f (x = midpoint)
        - have to estimate, not exact
model simplification - reduce variables/parameters
refining model - compare predicted data to real life data
problem solving cycle - identify problem, collect data, analyse, conclude
survey - collect info from sample of population, quicker & cheaper than census
census - collect info from every member of population, time-consuming, expensive, very accurate
sample - selection of population
systematic sampling - select every 'nth' member from list
stratified - split into categories, random selection from each
quota - specific condition selection from categories | not random
opportunity - selection convenient to sampler
simple random - every equally likely, independent selection
data - measurements with variable
qualitative - non-numerical
quantitative - numerical
discrete - categories/groups - fixed
continous - infinite range e.g weight
frequency table - discrete table data - class etc.
grouped frequency table
frequency polygon - graph, freq. against class mid-point - straight lines
Histogram - show frequencies of variables in classes
freq. density = freq. / class width
class width = upper limit - lower limit (max - min)

location - centre of data - average
linear interpolation - estimates value of variable position
dispersion - how spread out data values are
Lower Quartile - value that 25% of data is < or = (<=)
Upper quartile - value that 75% of data is <=

Standard deviation - root variance - s = Â¬/``variance
Variance - how spread out data is from mean
