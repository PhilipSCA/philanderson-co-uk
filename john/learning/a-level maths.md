Central tendency - mean, median, mode - centre of data
Median - if even,  average of 2 middle numbers - n/2, n/2 + 1
        - odd, n/2
Mean (grouped data) - mean = Σ fx / Σ f  (f = frequecy, x = midpoint)
 - you have to estimate mean, cant find exactly with grouped data
model simplification - reduce variables/parameters
refining a model - use real life data to predicted data, then improve
problem solving cycle - get problem, collect data, analyse, conclusion
survey - collecting info from a population, quicker & cheaper than census
population - whole group of every single thing
census - collecting info from every member of population - time,consuming, expensive, accurate
sample - selection from population
systematic sampling - select every 'nth' member from a list
stratified sampling - proportional selection from categories - random selection from each category
quota sampling - fixed selection from categories - NOT random 
opportunity sampling - selection convenient to sampler
simple random sampling - everyone equally likely to be chosen, each selection independent
data - measurements associated with a variable
qualitative variable - non-numerical
quantitative variable - numerical
discrete - categories/groups with gaps
continous - infinite range of values e.g weight
frequency table - discrete table data - class etc.
grouped frequency table 
frequency polygon - graph plotting freq. against class mid-point - straight lines
Histogram - show frequencies of variables in classes 
freq. density - freq. / class width
class

location - 'centre' of data (average)
linear interpolation - estimates value of variable position
dispersion - how spread out data values are
Lower quartile - value that 25% of data is < or = (<=)
Upper Q - value that 75% of data is < or =

Standard deviation - root of variance - s = root ¬/variance 
Variance - how spread out data is from mean
