## Biology
Plasma - liquid on blood that carries everything around
Platelet
### B1 - Cells
```
Cell - group of tissues working together
Nucleus - contains DNA for cell, controls cell
Cytoplasm - gel-like substance that fills cell, where chemical reactions happen
Mitochrondria - where respiration takes place due to enzymes, producing energy for cell
Ribosomes - protein is made for cell by proteinsynthesis
Cell membrane - controls what goes in/out of the cell, and keeps contents of cell inside
Cell wall - provides structure and support for the cell
Vacoule - contains fluids like water and cell sap
Chloroplasts - produce energy via photosynthesis
Chlorophyll - green pigment inside chloroplasts that absorb light for photosynthesis
Diffusion - movement of molecules - from an area of high to low concentration. Doesn't require energy. Affected by: temperature, distance, concentration
Osmosis - movement of water molecules from an area of high to low concentration through a semi-permeable membrane - passive process
Active transport - movement of molecules from an area of low to high concentration - active process, requires energy
```
### B2
```
Eukaryotic cells - complex cells with a nucleus.(plant & animal cells)
Prokaryotic cells - single-celled organisms with no nucleus, just DNA. Contains plasmids, flagella, pili, ribosomes,cytoplasm, cell membrane and wall and a nucleoid(DNA).
Stem cells - undifferentiated cells found in bone marrow or embryos in body
Embryonic stem cells - can turn into any cell in the body - replace faulty cells, therapeutic cloning. However, ethical concerns, can get contaminated and make patients more ill.
Adult stem cells - can only become a limited number of cells, with specific functions. Less useful, but no ethical problems and safer.
Meristem - plant stem cells - found in tip of roots and shoots and inbetween xylem or phloem
Mitosis - type of cell division - diploid body cell copies itself and divides into two identical daughter cells
Therapeutic cloning - using stem cells to clone organs for transplanting
Microscopes - eyepiece, objective lens, stage, coarse focus knob, fine focus knob, light
Binary fission - replicating process for prokaryotic cells.
Gas Exchange - when gases swap via diffusion - happens with 02 and CO2 in alveoli to red blood cells
```
### B3
```
Tissue - group of similar cells working together
Enzyme - biological catalyst for chemical reactions in body.
Carbohydrase - breaks down carbs --> simple sugars eg Amylase (made in salivary gland, pancreas, small intestine)
Proteases - converts proteins --> amino acids eg pepsin (made in stomach, pancreas, small intestine)
Lipases - converts lipids --> glycerol and fatty acids (pancreas, small intestine)
Substrate - substance that an enzyme works on.
Denature - an enzyme that changes shape because of broken bonds from overheating
Optimum temperature - temperature where the enzyme is most active
Benedict's test - sugars - ranges from blue-green-yellow-red
Iodine solution - starch - browny/orange if not, blue/black is there is
Biuret test - protein - turns purple if there is
Sudan III test - lipids - top layer of bright red if there is
```
### B4
```
Vena cava - carried deoxygenated blood to heart - a vein
Heart flow - Vena cava - right atrium-(tricuspid valve)-right ventricle - pulmonary artery - pulmonary vein - left atrium-(bicuspid valve)-left ventricle - aorta 
Artificial pacemaker - controls heartbeat with an electric current for heart
Arteries - carry blood away from heart - high pressure - normal lumen - thick muscle walls, elastic fibres
Vein - carry blood toward heart - low pressure - large lumen - thinner muscle walls, elastic fibre walls - valves to keep blood flow direction
Capillary - tiny - thin, permeable walls for quick rate of diffusion. Take away waste like CO2. Arteries branch into capillaries which join up to form veins.
Red blood cell - carry oxygen around body - biconcave disk & no nucleus for surface area - contains haemoglobin that binds with oxygen
White blood cell - defend against infections, immune system - phagocytosis, antibodies, antitoxins
Platelet - small fragment of cells - stops bleeding out and microorganisms in - helps blood clot at a wound
Plasma - plae liquid which carries everything in your body around
C.H.D - Coronary heart disease - coronary arteries blocked by layers of fat(chlorestrol), making lack of oxygen for heart.
Stents - tubes inserted into arteries keeping them open - effective, long-lasting, durable, surgery is quick
Statins - drugs reducing amount of chlorestrol in blood - reduces risk of other problems(strokes, heart attacks) - effective, used for years - must be taken regularly - risk someone forgets to take them - side effects like headaches, kidney failure, liver damage - not instant
Artificial Hearts - less likely to be rejected than donor, surgery -> bleeding and infection, parts can wear out/fail, blood clots or strokes. Patient has to take drugs aswell.
Biological valves - dont damage cells, less likely blood clots - needs replacing 10-20 yrs
Mechanical valves - lasts a lifetime - can lead to blood clots, patients need to take anti-cloning drugs, valves can be loud enough to hear.
Cancer - uncontrolled cell growth & division - forms a tumour - can be benign/malignant | Risk factors: Smoking, Obesity, UV exposure, Viral infection, Genetics (inheriting faulty genes)
Benign tumour - tumour grows until there is no more room - stays in one place - isn't usually dangerous or cancerous
Malignant tumour - tumour grows and spreads to neighbouring tissues - cells can break off into bloodstream, invade healthy tissues - form secondary tumours - dangerous, can be fatal - cancerous
```
##### Plants
```
Upper and lower epidermis - protective layer of cells, covered in waxy cuticle to prevent transpiration
Palisade mesophyll - underneath U.epidermis, transparent to let light reach palisade,contains chloroplasts for photosynthesis. Vertically block-shaped to fit as many as possible.
Spongy mesophyll - lots of air space for more diffusion rate, less chloroplasts in spongy cells
Stomata & guard cells - lower epidermis full of stomata, controlled by guard cells, for gas exchange of CO2 and O2 into and out of the cell for photosynthesis.
Xylem - tube of tissue from roots to leaf, carrying water and minerals from roots. One-way process upwards
Phloem - tube of cellulose, transports water, food nutrients etc. both up and down plant, with end walls and perforations
Transpiration - loss of water from plant through evaporation and diffusion on leaves. Makes more water get drawn up through xylem called transpiration stream --> Water then diffuses out of stomata --> evaporates into air.
Transpiration rate - affected by: light intensity, temperature, air flow, humidity
Potometer - method to test for transpiration rate
```
### B5
```
Pathogen - microorganisms that enter the body and cause disease.
Communicable disease - infectious, can easily spread
Non-communicable - unable to spread.
Types of Pathogens: 1) Bacteria - very small cells, reproduce rapidly inside body, producing harmful toxins to your cells and tissues - making you feel ill. (eg salmonella, gonorrhoea)
2) Virus - really tiny, not a cell, gets inside cells and reproduces rapidly, causing cells to burst. Cell damage makes you feel ill. (e.g Measles, HIV, TMV)
3) Protists - single-celled eukaryotes, live on or inside organisms and cause them damage. Often transferred to organisms by a vector(insect immune to the disease)(eg malaria)
4) Fungi - grow and penetrate human skin, or surface of plants, causing disease.  Produce spores which spread to other living things.
Pathogens are spread by: Water, air and direct contact
Measles - spread by air - droplets from a sneeze/cough - red skin rash, fever, can be fatal
HIV - STD, or exchanging bodily fluids(blood) - controlled by anti-retrovial drugs - HIV attacks immune system, and at late stage becomes aids
TMV - Tobacco Mosaic Virus - causes a mosaic pattern on leaves, making them discoloured - slowing down rate of photosynthesis and affecting growth
Rose black spot - fungal disease - purple or black spots on leaves, making them fall off. Spreads through water and wind, can be treated with fungicides.
Malaria - protist - lives on mosquitos, from infected animals - vectors - spread by biting something else - repeated fevers, headaches, muscle pains etc - can be fatal
Salmonella - food poisoning - caused by toxins produced in intestines - can cause: fever, stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea.
Gonorrhoea - STD - pain during urination, thick yellow/green discharge from penis or vagina - treated with penicillin, however has become more resistant.
Human Defences: 
Skin - barrier to pathogens, also secretes antimicrobial substances
Hair and mucus - act as a trap to pathogens
Trachea and bronchi - covered in cilia and mucus to trap pathogens, cilia move mucus to back of throat to be swallowed
Stomach - produces HCl acid to kill pathogens
White blood cells - part of immune system - have a large nucleus, attack pathogens by phagocytosis, producing antibodies that lock onto antigens, produces antitoxins to cancel out any toxins.
Phagocytosis - process of a WBC engulfing and digesting pathogens as a line of defense - done by phagocytes
Antigens - shaped holes or stems on a pathogen that antibodies can latch onto, each pathogen's antigen shape is unique
Lymphocytes - the WBCs that produce antibodies
Semmelweis - Austria - 1840s - realised mothers treated by doctors got the disease more often than ones treated by midwives - told doctors to wash hands after operations - death rate fell 18% --> 1%
```
### B6
```
Vaccination - dead or inactive form of pathogen injected, stimulated WBCs to produce antibodies and kill it. When you are infected with the real pathogen, WBCs recognise it-with memory cells-and make adapted specific antibodies to quickly kill the pathogen and prevent you from getting disease.
 . If a higher % of population is vaccinated, disease spreads less, and can be managed. If everyone is vaccinated, the disease could die.
Painkillers - drugs that relieve pain/symptoms - don't cure disease (e.g aspirin, paracetamol, ibuprofen) 
Antibiotics - drugs that kill bacteria without damaging your cells, (e.g penicillin, methicillin)
 . Don't kill viruses - antibiotics attack the cell wall, but viruses live inside our cells, making it difficult to kill virus without damaging cells.
 . Bacteria can mutate and become resistant to antibiotics if over-prescribed drugs or not finishing whole course of antibiotics
4 Things to consider when making drugs:
1) Safe - no unwanted side effects
2) Effective - how good at treating the disease
3) Stable - can be stored for a long period of time and used in normal conditions
4) uptake and removal - how the body absorbs the drug, and clears it when used

3 Things to consider in a drug:
1) Efficiacy - effectiveness
2) Toxicity - is it toxic to humans?
3) Dosage - how often is it needed

Drug development stages:
1) Tested using computer models or cells in a lab
2) Tested on animals to test for side effects
3) Tested on small group of healthy humans to check its safety. Optimum dose is found.
4) Tested on small group of diseased humans.
5) Drug tested on large group of diseased patients - split into two groups - clinical double blind trials - patient and doctor dont know whether they have a placebo or not - monitor effectiveness, dosage, safety, side effects.
6) Drug ready to be prescribed.
Herd immunity - immunisation of a large proportion of a population, which reduces spread of pathogens
Placebo - inactive form of a drug, to see any psychological effects.

##### B something - Yr 11 - Body responses
```
Homeostasis - regulation of condition inside your body to maintain a stable internal environment, in response to internal/  external changes - body temperature, blood glucose level, water levels
Negative feedback - when something gets too high/low, receptors detect the stimulus, coordination centre organises a response and effector acts to increase/decrease level - keeps on happening until not stimulated 
Central Nervous System - brain, spinal cord  - connected to the body by sensory neurons and motor neurons (in mammals) - coordinates the response from the receptor to effector
Sensory neurons - neurons that carry electrical impulses from the receptor to the CNS
Motor neurons - neurons that carry electrical impulses from the CNS to the effector
Stimuli - the change in the environment that triggers a change 
Receptor - cells that detect stimuli - one of 5 senses
Effectors - muscles or glands - respond to nervous impulses and perform an action for change
synapse - the air gap connection between two neurons - signal transferred by chemicals that diffuse across gap, set off a new signal in next neurons
Reflexes - rapid, automatic responses to stimuli that dont need conscious part of the brain - quicker as you dont need to think
Reflex arc - passage of information in a reflex (from receptor to effector) - go through spinal cord/unconscious part of brain
relay neuron - neuron inside spinal cord, connects sensory to motor neuron
Practical for reaction time:
caffeine - drug that speeds up someones reaction time
1) person put their arm on edge of table, person 2 holds ruler between thumb & forefinger
2) person 2 drops ruler at random time, person 1 catches it as quick as possible
3) Record cm on ruler where its caught - repeat the test several times, calculate mean distance
4) Repeat steps 1-3 after having a caffeinated drink after 10 minutes
- Fair test - use same person, same hand, ruler dropped from same height, person 1 hasnt drank any caffeine recently
