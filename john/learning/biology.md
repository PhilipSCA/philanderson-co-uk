## Biology
Plasma - liquid on blood that carries everything around
Platelet
### B1 - Cells
```
Cell - group of tissues working together
Nucleus - contains DNA for cell, controls cell
Cytoplasm - gel-like substance that fills cell, where chemical reactions happen
Mitochrondria - where respiration takes place due to enzymes, producing energy for cell
Ribosomes - protein is made for cell by proteinsynthesis
Cell membrane - controls what goes in/out of the cell, and keeps contents of cell inside
Cell wall - provides structure and support for the cell
Vacoule - contains fluids like water and cell sap
Chloroplasts - produce energy via photosynthesis
Chlorophyll - green pigment inside chloroplasts that absorb light for photosynthesis
Diffusion - movement of molecules - from an area of high to low concentration. Doesn't require energy. Affected by: temperature, distance, concentration
Osmosis - movement of water molecules from an area of high to low concentration through a semi-permeable membrane - passive process
Active transport - movement of molecules from an area of low to high concentration - active process, requires energy
```
### B2
```
Eukaryotic cells - complex cells with a nucleus.(plant & animal cells)
Prokaryotic cells - single-celled organisms with no nucleus, just DNA. Contains plasmids, flagella, pili, ribosomes,cytoplasm, cell membrane and wall and a nucleoid(DNA).
Stem cells - undifferentiated cells found in bone marrow or embryos in body
Embryonic stem cells - can turn into any cell in the body - replace faulty cells, therapeutic cloning. However, ethical concerns, can get contaminated and make patients more ill.
Adult stem cells - can only become a limited number of cells, with specific functions. Less useful, but no ethical problems and safer.
Meristem - plant stem cells - found in tip of roots and shoots and inbetween xylem or phloem
Mitosis - type of cell division - diploid body cell copies itself and divides into two identical daughter cells
Therapeutic cloning - using stem cells to clone organs for transplanting
Microscopes - eyepiece, objective lens, stage, coarse focus knob, fine focus knob, light
Binary fission - replicating process for prokaryotic cells.
Gas Exchange - when gases swap via diffusion - happens with 02 and CO2 in alveoli to red blood cells
```
### B3
```
Tissue - group of similar cells working together
Enzyme - biological catalyst for chemical reactions in body.
Carbohydrase - breaks down carbs --> simple sugars eg Amylase (made in salivary gland, pancreas, small intestine)
Proteases - converts proteins --> amino acids eg pepsin (made in stomach, pancreas, small intestine)
Lipases - converts lipids --> glycerol and fatty acids (pancreas, small intestine)
Substrate - substance that an enzyme works on.
Denature - an enzyme that changes shape because of broken bonds from overheating
Optimum temperature - temperature where the enzyme is most active
Benedict's test - sugars - ranges from blue-green-yellow-red
Iodine solution - starch - browny/orange if not, blue/black is there is
Biuret test - protein - turns purple if there is
Sudan III test - lipids - top layer of bright red if there is
```
### B4
```
Vena cava - carried deoxygenated blood to heart - a vein
Heart flow - Vena cava - right atrium-(tricuspid valve)-right ventricle - pulmonary artery - pulmonary vein - left atrium-(bicuspid valve)-left ventricle - aorta 
Artificial pacemaker - controls heartbeat with an electric current for heart
Arteries - carry blood away from heart - high pressure - normal lumen - thick muscle walls, elastic fibres
Vein - carry blood toward heart - low pressure - large lumen - thinner muscle walls, elastic fibre walls - valves to keep blood flow direction
Capillary - tiny - thin, permeable walls for quick rate of diffusion. Take away waste like CO2. Arteries branch into capillaries which join up to form veins.
