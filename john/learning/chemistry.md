### Atom discovery

```
John Dalton - 1803 - discovered atoms, described them as solid spheres, different spheres make diff elements
J.J Thompson - 1897 - discovered electrons, created 'Plum Pudding model'
Ernest Rutherford - 1909 - fired positively charged alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold, some deflected and some went backwards. Concluded nucleus in the center, electrons around - 'Nuclear model'
Niels Bohr - Realised electrons orbit in fixed shells, with a fixed energy and distance. (Otherwise atom would collapse)
```

## C2 - Periodic table

Alloy - mixture of two elements, where atleast one is a metal

Metals - found in left and middle, have few outer shell electrons, lose or share electrons to get a full outer shell, become positive. 

Metal PROPERTIES:

- strong but malleable
- good heat and electricity conductors
- high melting & boiling points

Non-metals - found in right and top, have more electrons on outer shell, react and gain or share electrons and become negative.

non-metal PROPERTIES:
- dull, brittle
- not always solid at room temp.
- don't conduct electricity
- lower density

Transition metals - middle of periodic table - properties:

- dense, strong, shiny conductors.
- often have more than one ion - Cu2+, Co3+
- Coloured
- make good catalysts in compounds

Alkali metals - Group 1 metals - soft, low density. Have 1 electron on outer shell, react with non-metals to form ionic compounds. Trend as you go DOWN group:

1) Increased reactivity - outer shell is further away from nucleus, weakening electrostatic forces, less energy required for it to be lost.

2) Lower melting & boiling points - same reason

3) Higher atomic mass

Halogens - Group 7 non-metals - coloured vapours - all come as diatomic molecules, covalently bonded. Can either covalently bond or ionic bond with metals. Trend as you go DOWN the group:

1) Less reactivity - harder to gain electron when outer shell electrons are further away from nucleus, less attraction

2) Higher melting & boiling points

3) Higher atomic mass

Noble gases - Group 0 - inert colourless gases - unreactive as they have full outer shell - monatomic gases, non-flammable. Trend as you go DOWN group:

1) Boiling point increases - number of electrons increase, greater intermolecular forces so more energy needed.

### discovery of periodic table

```
John Newlands - 1864 - ordered elements by atomic weight or R. atomic mass; noticed some patterns but table was incomplete.
Dimitri Mendelev - 1869 - ordered elements by atomic mass - put similar properties together - left gaps for undiscovered elements.
```
## C3 - Structure and bonding
```
Ionic bonding - metal and non-metal bond, transfer electrons  - metal becomes positive, non-metal becomes negative, which makes them attract
Dot and cross diagram
Ionic compounds - compound that contains ionic bonds.
Giant ionic lattice structure properties: 
- very strong as held together by electrostatic attraction in all directions
- high melting and boiling points
- Cant conduct electricity, when solid. When melted or dissolved, ions separate and can conduct electricity.

Empirical formula - simplest balanced ratio of elements for an equation
Covalent bonding - bonding between non-metals, positive nucleus attracted to shared nucleus, making covalent bonds very strong
Simple molecular structures - substances containing very stong covalent bonds, but held together by weak intermolecular forces:
- melting and boiling point very low
- Mostly gases or liquids at room temp
- as molecules get bigger, forces get stronger, boiling point increases
- Can't conduct electricity

Polymer - a long chain of repeated units, a long molecule
Macromolecules - giant covalent structures - diamond and graphite
Allotrope - the same element in the same state but with a different arrangement. Allotropes of carbon:

Diamond - each carbon atoms covalently bonds with 4 other carbon atoms.
- Making diamond really hard and strong. 
- Very high melting & boiling point. 
- Doesnt conduct electricity.

Graphite - arranged in sheets of hexagons, joined by intermolecular forces. Each carbon atom covalently bonded with 3. Layers are held weakly and can move over each other, making it soft and slippery, used for lubrication. 
- High melting and boiling point
- **CAN** conduct electricity - each carbon atom has 1 spare electron.

Graphene - one layer of graphite, strong and light, conductor.
Fullerene - hollow balls or nanotubes, made of hexagons and pentagons.
- Huge surface area
- good catalysts and lubricants
- conductor of electricity and heat
- high tensile strength

Metallic bonding - two metals bonding in a sea of delocalised electrons. Properties same as metals. (strong but malleable as layers can slide, high melting and boiling points, solids at room temp, conductors)
Alloy - mixture of atleast one metal. Harder than pure metals
States of matter - solid(s), liquid(l), gas(g), aqueous(aq)
```
## C4 - Chemical calculations
```
Relative formula mass - atomic mass of all elements in the compound added together - Mr
Mole - 6.02x10^23 - One mole of an element is the same atomic mass as one atom of the element
Limiting reactant - the reactant that gets all used up and limits how much product is formed
Volume of gas = (mass of gas/Mr of gas) x 24, at room temperature and pressure.
Concentration - amount of solute there is in a given volume.
Concentration(g/dm3) = mass of solute(g)/volume of solvent(dm3)
Moles = mass/Mr, Mass = moles/Mr
Atom economy - the amount of useful product in the reactants. = (Mr of wanted product/Mr of all reactants) x 100
Percentage yield - the ratio of products formed to reactants used - %
Titration - method of finding out concentration of ions - add increments of another solution until colour change
```
## C5 - Chemical changes
```
Acid - substance that produces H+ ions when dissolved in water. Has a pH of less than 7. Strong acids ionise completely in water, releasing more H+ ions.
Base - any substance that makes a salt with an acid - has to be an ionic compound
Salt - compound formed when hydrogen ions in the acid are replaced by metal ions.
Neutralisation - acid + base --> salt + water
pH - measure of concentration of H+ ions in solution. has a base 10 logarithmetic scale
Acid + metal Oxide(base) --> salt + water
Acid + metal hydroxide(base) --> salt + water
Acid + metal carbonate(base) --> salt + water + carbon dioxide
MASH - Metal + acid --> salt + hydrogen
Metal + water --> Metal hydroxide + hydrogen
Reactivity series:
Potassium
Sodium
Lithium
Calcium
Magnesium
Aluminium
(EXTRACTED BY ELECTROLYSIS)
***carbon***
Zinc
Iron
Tin
Lead
(EXTRACTED BY REDUCTION FROM CARBON)
***hydrogen***
copper, silver, gold, platinum

Metals below carbon are extracted by heating it up with carbon, as the carbon takes the oxygen away from the metal, making CO2, reducing the metal.
Displacement reaction - when a more reactive metal replaces a less reactive one in a compound
Ionic equation - where only elements getting oxidised or reduced are shown, and the rest are spectator ions.
```
## C6 - Electrolysis
```
Electrolysis - process of splitting up ionic compounds using electricity - very expensive
Electrolyte - solution that current is passed through, either molten ionic or aqueous
Electrode - cathode or anode - electrical graphite rods
Reduction - gain of electrons (loss of oxygen)
Oxidation - loss of electrons (gain of oxygen)
REDOX reaction - when both reduction and oxidation occur in the same reaction. Happens in all metal + acid reactions.
Extraction - for metals with high melting points, you lower the melting point by adding cryolite and make it molten
Cathode - negative electrode - attracts cations and forms a metal through reduction.
Anode - positive electrode - attracts anions - forms gas by oxidation.
Half equation for metals = Mx+ + xe- --> M
Half equation for nonmetals - 2Yx- ---> Y2 + 2xe-
Half eq. for hydrogen = 2H+ + 2e- ---> H2
Half eq. for hydroxide = 4OH- ---> O2 + 2H20
```

## C8 - Rates of reaction
```
Collision theory - Particles have to collide with enough energy for the collision to be successful
Activation energy - minimun amount of energy needed to break bonds and start reaction
Conservation of mass - in a chemical reaction, mass of reactants = mass of products
Reversible reaction - a reaction where the products are able to turn back into reactants

Rate of reaction factors:
1) Temperature - more temp = more kinetic energy in particles - particles move faster | more frequent, successful collisions
2) Concentration/pressure - more concentration = more particles in same volume | more frequent collisions
3) Surface area - breaking up a solid into smaller parts increases its surface area: volume ratio - more particles exposed to surface of other reactant = more space to collide = more frequent collisions
4) Catalyst - speeds up a reaction, without being used up - decreases activation energy needed - provides an alternate pathway with a lower activation energy

Practicals: 
1) Colour change - black cross - add chemical - record how long it takes for black cross to disappear (high turbidity)
2) Change in mass - substance reacts with liquid - evaporation out of beaker - record mass at regular intervals - quicker the mass drops, faster the reaction - plot a graph(g/s)
3) Volume of gas given off - gas syringe into beaker - substance reacts with liquid - record gas given out of beaker at regular intervals - more gas given off, quicker the reaction (cm^3s^-1)- plot a graph
Graphs - gradient of the line at any point on a reaction/time graph = rate of reaction - steeper the gradient | faster the reaction

Turbidity - cloudiness/clearness of a liquid
Mean rate of reaction = amount of reactant used|product formed / time 
Closed system - nothing can escape or enter the system
Equilibrium - when the concentration of the reactants and products are balanced and wont change. - only in a 'closed system' - a balance is a reversible reaction - forward reaction happens at same rate as backward reaction
 - the position of equilibrium can lie to the left or right(reactants or products) - depending on factors:
   1) Temperature - INCREASE temperature = equilibrium move to ENDOTHERMIC reaction - use more heat
                  - DECREASE temperature = equilibrium move to EXOTHERMIC reaction - produce more heat
                  - You will get more product for wherever the equilibrium is, and fewer of the other reactant.
   2) Pressure (gases) - INCREASE pressure = equilibrium moves in direction of FEWEST gas molecules, to reduce pressure
                       - DECREASE pressure = equilibrium moves in direction of MOST gas molecules - to increase pressure
Le Chatelier's principle - the equilibrium position can be changed if a change in conditions is introduced to the system
- In reversible reactions, reaction can be endo/exothermic. If reaction is endothermic in one direction, it is exothermic in the other. (vice versa)
