# Computer Science
Decomposition - breaking a complex problem into smaller problems to solve individually
Abstraction - filtering unnecessary information out of a problem and focusing on what is important.
Algorithmic thinking - logical way of solving problems, step by step
Pseudo-code - follows a similar structure of every coding language - easily readable - can be converted into any programming language
Flowcharts - diagram showing algorithms, using different symbols, arrows.
Casting - changing a data type
Variable -  an identifier with a name that stores a(n adjustable) value - can be changed
Constant - variable that cant be changed
CASE statement - performs different actions for different values of same variable
Selection - when program **interacts** with user
Sequence - an order of instructions in a program
Iteration - when the program uses loops (For, Repeat-until, while, do-while)
Indefinite iteration - when the loop repeats until a condition is met
Definite iteration - when loop repeats exact number of times instructed.
Nested iteration - loop inside another loop
Subroutines - set of instructions stored under one name, function or procedure
procedure - function that doesnt return a value
Global variable - variable that can be used anywhere in code
ASCII - 7-bit character set - (128 characters)
ASCII extended - 8-bit - 256 characters
Unicode - 16-bit - 65,000+ characters - every possible character in every language
Syntax error - code doesn't follow rules or grammar of the language(SPaG error) - computer doesnt understand - program doesnt run
Logic error - unexpected output - program does run (Human error)
Bit - single binary digit
Nibble - 4 bits
Byte - 8 bits
KiloByte(KB) - 1000 bytes
Megabyte(MB) - 1000 Kilobytes
Gigabyte(GB) - 1000 Megabytes
Terabyte(TB) - 1000 GB

Binary search - ordered lists - start in middle, slice etc
Linear search - works in any list - start from beginning, check each item

Bubble sort - sorts unordered lists - compares first values and swaps - biggest value to right
Merge sort - decomposition method for sorting unordered lists - split, sort, merge back
Insertion sort - sorts unordered lists - compares each value to first value, swaps - biggest value to left
