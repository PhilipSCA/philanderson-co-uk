# Differentiation
derivative - result of differentiating
f'(x) - d/dx (xn) == nx^x-1

- differentiating tells you gradient of tangent to curve at a point
- used to find rates of change

Normal - line perpendicular to curve
To find tangents/normals:
1) Differentiate
2) Find gradient || Normal = -1 / gradient
3) write in form y - y1 = m(x - x1) |OR| y = mx + c

Differentiating from first principles:
f'x = lim ( f(x+h) - f(x)/ h )
- find f'x, simplify - remove h from denominator
- set h = 0 to simplify

Stationary points - point of graph where curve flattens/gradient=0
 - can be maximum, minimum or point of inflection(poi)
 - used to find dy/dx = 0
 - to find minimum/maximum:
   - differentiate again - f''x - d^2 y/dx^2
   - if f''x > 0 --> minimum
   - if f''x < 0 --> maximum

- f'(x) > 0 || gradient = positive || function increasing
- f'(x) < 0 || gradient = negative || function decreasing
- bigger gradient = steeper - quicker y changes as x changes

Curve sketching:
1) find where curve crosses axis
    - y-axis - x = 0
    - x-axis - f(x) = 0 (2 roots)
2) get gradient & stationary points
3) when x gets big, factorise, take out highest power of x from every term

### Diff Trig functions:
fx = sin x | f'x = cos x
fx = cos x | f'x = -sin x
fx = tan x | f'x = sec 2 x

fx = cot x | f'x = -csc 2 x
fx = sec x | f'x = sec x tan x
fx = csc x | f'x = -csc x cot x

# Integration

- 'opposite' of differentiation
Constant of integration - 'C' - can be any number

To integrate:
- add 1 to power, then divide by same power
- x^2  = x^3/3

- can check answers by differentiating

To find C:
- use points given
- substitute x, y of point into integral, then solve

Definite integrals - limits - values to integrate between:
 - Answer = top limit - bottom limit
 - used to find area under a curve
 - when bottom limit below x-axis = negative || work out (0 - top) and (0 - bottom) separately, then add together
 - to find area enclosed in 2 lines, add/subtract integral areas

to find 1 limit:
1) integrate
2) substitute variable, use formula: top - bottom = ans
