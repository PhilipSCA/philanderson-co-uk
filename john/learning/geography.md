## Physical Landscapes in the UK

### Coasts
4 Processes of Erosion (coasts & rivers):
1) Hydraulic action - the sheer impact of waves, and traps air in cracks, increasing pressure on rock
2) Abrasion - the waves carry rock that get thrown into the cliff face, breaking away rock
3) Attrition - particles carried by the waves break down as they collide with each other
4) Solution - soft rocks dissolving in the seawater
Fetch - length of water over which the wind has blown
Rock arrangement
Mechanical weathering - breakdown of rocks without any chemical change (freeze-thaw, onion-skin)
Chemical weathering - breakdown of rocks with the mineral composition being changed
Biological weathering - breakdown of rocks caused by nature
Swash - power of wave moving up the beach
Backwash - power of wave going down the beach back to the sea
Constructive wave - smaller, gentler waves - strong swash, weak backwash
Destructive wave - bigger waves - weak swash, strong backwash
4 methods of material transportation:
1) Traction - large boulders pushed along water bed
2) Saltation - hopping or bouncing pebbles, too heavy to be suspensed
3) Suspension - rocks carried within the water
4) Solution - dissolved rock carried in the water
Longshore drift - the movement that the waves carry rocks/beach amterial in correlation to prevailing wind
Estuary - end of the river
Scarp - steep cut in side of a slope
Deposition - dropping off of material, how beaches build up
Groynes - wooden/stone fences built adjacent to coast, trap material from Longshore drift
Discordant coastline - coast made up of alternating bands of hard and soft rock vertially, at right angles to the coast.
Concordant coastline - coast made up of alternating bands of hard and soft rock horizontally, parallel to coast
Shoreline - zone between high tide and low tide
##### Landforms
Headland - hard rock that juts out to sea - erodes from a crack --> cave --> arch --> stack --> stump
Bay - a crescent shaped indentation on a coastline - usually a beach - soft rock inbetween hard rock
Beach - sand/shingle - formed by constructive waves depositing material - shingle beaches made from more destructive waves
Spit - form at sharp bends in coastline - LSD deposits material past bend into sea - Strong winds/waves can curve end of spit (recurved end). Area behind spit sheltered from waves, becomes mud flat or salt marsh.
Bar - spit that joins two headlands together.
Lagoon - little pool in the middle of a bar
Wave-cut notch - notch formed from the base of the cliff being eroded
Sand dune - sand deposited is moved up beach by wind, obstacles(e.g driftwood) break wind speed - sand is deposited forming embryo dune - vegetation stabilises sand, encouraging more deposition - embryo dune --> foredune --> Mature dune
Dune slack - tiny pools formed in hollows between dunes
##### Defences
Hard engineering - man-made structures built to control the flow of sea and reduce flooding or erosion
1) Sea wall - concave hard wall, reflects waves back to sea. Adv:very effective, durable | Dis: very expensive(£2k per metre), lasts 30-50 yrs
2) Rock armour - large boulders piled up along coats, break & absorb wave energy | Adv: fairly cheap, easy to maintain, can be used for fishing | Dis: unattractive, doesnt match local geology, need replacing often
3) Gabions - wall of wire cages of rocks - Absorb wave energy | Adv: cheap(£100 per metre), easy to build | Dis: look very ugly & unnatural, not long-lasting(wire cages corrode over time)
4) Groynes - wooden/stone fences built at right angles to coast - trap material from LSD| Adv: builds up beach - encourages tourism, fairly cheap | Dis: starve beaches further down coastline, leading to more erosion elsewhere, unattractive
Soft engineering - natural schemes set up using knowledge of sea to reduce effects of flooding/erosion
1) Beach nourishment - Sand/shingle pumped onto an beach to build it up | Adv: blends in with beach, attracts tourists | Dis: needs to be replaced constantly, sand has to be brought from elsewhere, pretty expensive
2) Reprofiling - taking sand from lower beach and adding it to upper part of beach | Adv: cheap, simple, works | Dis: Only works when wave energy is low, needs to be repeated continously
3) Dune regeneration - restoring sand dunes by planting vegetation to stabilise sand - | Adv: cheap, natural-looking, creates a barrier | Dis: protection limited to small area, can be damaged by weather, areas zoned off
Managed retreat - allow sea to flood land behind, become marshland | Adv: cheap, easy, doesnt need maintaining, can create new habitats for plants & animals, natural defence | Dis: Land lost, Landowners need compensation (5k-10k per hectare) 

### Rivers
Upper course - steep gradient - V-shaped valley - narrow, shallow channel - Waterfalls, gorges, interlocking spurs
Middle course - medium gradient - gently sloping valley sides - Wider, deeper channel
Lower course - Gentle gradient - Very wide, almost flat valley, Very wide and deep channel 
Source - start of the river
Vertical erosion - deepens river valley and channel - dominant in upper course
Lateral erosion - widens river valley and channel - during formation of meanders - dominant in middle & lower course.
4 Processes of Erosion (coasts & rivers):
- Hydraulic action - force of water colliding with rocks, traps air particles - puts pressure on rock, breaking rocks
- Abrasion - eroded rocks in river scrape against channel, wearing it away. Most common type of erosion(rivers)
- Attrition - eroded rocks in river crash into each other, break into smaller pieces. Particle size decreases along river
- Solution - river water dissolves soft rocks (e.g chalk, limestone)
4 methods of material transportation:
- Traction - large boulders pushed along water bed
- Saltation - hopping or bouncing pebbles, too heavy to be suspensed
- Suspension - rocks carried within the water
- Solution - dissolved rock carried in the water
Deposition - river drops material when it loses its velocity/energy - dominant in lower course - happens if there is less water, more eroded material, water is shallower, or when river reaches the mouth
Hydrograph - shows peak discharge, lag time, rising & falling limb with rainfall
Discharge - volume of river water flowing per second - measured in cumecs(cubic metres per second, m3/s)
Lag time - delay between peak rainfall and peak discharge - time for all rainfall to flow in river - surface runoff or infiltration underground
Rising limb - increase in river discharge, as rainwater flows into river
Falling limb - decrease in discharge, as river returns to normal level
Factors affecting flood risk:
1) Heavy rainfall - too much water to infiltrate - more surface runoff -  lag time shorter, more discharge
2) Geology(rock type) - impermeable rocks dont allow infiltration - runoff increased - more discharge
3) Prolonged rainfall - saturate soil - cant infiltrate further rainfall - runoff increased
4) Relief - surface runoff faster down slopes - increases discharge
5) Land use - buildings, roads are impermeable, drains quickly transport runoff to rivers, trees store water - reducing discharge
##### Landforms
Waterfalls - upper course - area of soft rock eroded after hard rock, creates a 'step', then a steep drop
Plunge pool - hard rock eventually undercut by erosion, unsupported and collapses - Collapsed rock swirls at bottom and erodes soft rock by abrasion, creating a plunge pool
Gorge - Waterfall when over time more undercutting happens and waterfall retreats, leaving hard rock sticking out on sides
Interlocking spurs - upper course - rivers cant laterally erode, winds around high hillsides that interlock with each other

Meanders - middle course - large bends in river - current is faster on outside bend as channel is deeper, erosion happens - slower on inside bend, material deposited - forms slip-off slopes
Thalweg - fastest flow of river - on outside bends
Ox-bow lakes -  U-shaped meander - river breaks through neck - river flows along shortest course - deposition cuts off meander - an ox-bow is formed

Flood plains - flat, wide valley area of land on sides of river - deposites material when flooded, builds up flood plain
Levees - natural embankments along edges of river channel - during flood, heaviest ma terial deposited closest to river, builds  up and creates levees on edges.
Estuaries - found at mouth - tidal area - floods deposit silt & sand & form mudflats. Mudflats exposed at low tide.
##### Defences
Hard engineering - man-made structures to control flow of rivers: 
1) Dams & reserviors - barriers built across rivers to trap water and release it in a controlled way. Reservoir forms behind dam. Adv: can generate HE power, attract tourists, prevent floods downstream | Dis: Veryy expensive, reservoir can flood existing settlements, sediment deposited in reservoir - farmland downstream less fertile, habitats flooded - rotting vegetation - releases methane(greenhoue gas)
2) Channel straightening - meanders removed by building straight, artificial channels. | Adv: water moves quicker, more water held at once - reduces flood risk | Dis: speeding up river may increase flood risk downstream, dredging needs doing frequently
   - Dredging - digging bottom of river so it can hold more water
3) Embankments - built raised walls along river bank | Adv: quite effective - river can hold more water, floods less likely | Dis: unnatural, quite expensive, risk of severe flooding if they break, or too short, water sped up increases flood risk downstream
4) Flood relief channels - divert water around built-up areas and join river later down course | Adv: Removes excess water from river, gates on channels - release of water is controlled | Dis: Expensive, can cause flooding where relief channel joins the river back
Soft engineering:
1) Flood warnings - Environmental Agency - warnings through TV, radio, internet | Adv: residents can prepare sandbags/flood boards & move possessions upstairs, evacuate - reduces impact | Dis: Don't prevent flood, people may not have access to warnings, modifying buildings is expensive, doesn't guarantee safety - flash floods happen quickly
2) Flood plain zoning - restricting building on floodplains that are likely to flood | Adv: risk reduced - fewer impermeable surfaces created(roads), impact is less, buildings wont be as damaged | Dis: Cant help areas with existing buildings, urban expansion limited, planners have to decide what type of flood to plan for
3) Planting trees - intercepts rainwater | Adv: increases lag time, decrease discharge, reduces soil erosion, provides habitats | Dis: less land available for farming
4) River restoration - making river natural (eg. removing levees) so can flood naturally | Adv: Little maintenance needed, discharge reduced, better habitats | Dis: Local flood risk can increase 

## The Living World
### Ecosystems
Biotic - living
Abiotic - non-living
Ecosystem - all biotic and abiotic things working together to live in an area
Producer - greens - uses sunlight energy to produce food
Consumer - gets its energy by eating other organisms, producers or consumers
Decomposer - organism that gets its energy by breaking down dead material, dead producers and consumers (fallen leaves or animal remains. Bacteria/ fungi)
Food chain - diagram - transfer of energy from ONE organism to another and another by eating
Food web - diagram - a network of food chains, linking multiple organisms in one ecosystem together - transfer of energy in an ecosystem.
### Tropical Rainforests
Climate - 20-28C over year, high rainfall - 2000mm per year - rains every day
Epiphyte - plants that grow on other plants, take nutrients/moisture from air (e.g fern, orchids)
Soil - isn't fertile - heavy rain washes nutrients away. There are surface nutrients
Animals - believed to have more species than any other ecosystem.
Biodiversity - the variety of organisms living in an area, both plants and animals
Symbiotic relationship - where they each depend on each other for survival
Cecropia trees - hollow stems, produce energy-rich foodstuff at base of their leaves
Plants - trees, evergreen - height, 50m+ - vegetation cover, dense - very little light reaches floor
Plant adaptations:
- thick, waxy leaves with pointed drip-tips - channel rainwater to point, encourage run-off - weight of water cant damage plant
- Smooth, thin bark - no need to protect trunk from cold weather. Smooth surface - water run-off easier and quicker
- Large, stable buttress roots - support tall tree trunks, and get more nutrients
- Plants drop leaves gradually throughout year - meaning they grow all year round
### Hot Deserts

## Urban Issues & Challenges
### London
### Rio De Janiero
### Urbanisation

### Natural Hazards
Geological hazards - hazard caused by land and tectonic processes - volcanoes, earthquakes, landslides
Meteorological hazards - hazards caused by weather and climate
Hazard risk - probability of people being affected by a hazard in an area
Primary effects - immediate impacts caused by hazard itself
Secondary effects - impact that happen after as a result of the primary effects.
Tectonic plates - plates that make up our crust
Crust - Earth's outer layer
Continental Crust - thicker (30-50km) and less dense
Oceanic crust -  thinner (5-10km) and more dense
Mantle - layer after crust
Destructive plate margin - two plates colliding towards each other:
 oceanic + continental --> denser oceanic plate subducted(forced down into mantle) & destroyed, creating gas rich magma. Volcanoes and ocean trenches occur here.
 oceanic + oceanic --> cooler, denser one subducts into mantle.
 continental + continental --> ground folds upwards --> fold mountains.
Constructive plate margins - two plates moving away from each other - magma rises from mantle to fill gap & cools, making new crust
Conservative margins - two plates sliding sideways past each other, or same direction at different speeds
Focus - point where earthquake starts
Epicentre - point on Earth's surface straight above focus
