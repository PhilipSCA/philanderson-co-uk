## Coasts
Hydraulic action - the sheer impact of waves, and traps air in cracks, increasing pressure on rock
Abrasion - the waves carry rock that get thrown into the cliff face, breaking away rock
Attrition - particles carried by the waves break down as they collide with each other
Solution - soft rocks dissolving in the seawater
Fetch - length of water over which the wind has blown
Rock arrangement
Mechanical weathering - breakdown of rocks without any chemical change (freeze-thaw, onion-skin)
Chemical weathering - breakdown of rocks with the mineral composition being changed
Biological weathering - breakdown of rocks caused by nature
Swash - power of wave moving up the beach
Backwash - power of wave going down the beach back to the sea
Constructive wave - smaller, gentler waves - strong swash, weak backwash
Destructive wave - bigger waves - weak swash, strong backwash
Wave-cut notch - notch formed from the base of the cliff being eroded
Headland - hard rock that juts out to sea
Bay - a crescent shaped indentation on a coastline - usually a beach
Traction - large boulders pushed along water bed
Saltation - hopping or bouncing pebbles, too heavy to be suspensed
Suspension - rocks carried within the water
Solution - dissolved rock carried in the water
Longshore drift - the movement that the waves carry rocks/beach amterial in correlation to prevailing wind
Estuary - end of the river
Scarp - steep cut in side of a slope
Deposition - dropping off of material, how beaches build up
Groynes - wooden/stone fences built adjacent to coast, trap material from Longshore drift
Discordant coastline - coast made up of alternating bands of hard and soft rock vertially, at right angles to the coast.
Concordant coastline - coast made up of alternating bands of hard and soft rock horizontally, parallel to coast
Bar - spit that joins two headlands together.
