### random terms
Optimum population - the standard of living being maintained because the resources can be used to their best advantage
Wind sheer - difference in wind speeds
Coriolis effect - winds curving because of Earth's rotation
Elliptical orbit - oval shaped orbit of Sun from Earth
Precession - Earth's axis wobbles like a spinning top
Biotic - living
Abiotic - non-living
Ecosystem - all biotic and abiotic things working together to live in an area
Producer - greens - uses sunlight energy to produce food
Consumer - gets its energy by eating other organisms, producers or consumers
Decomposer - organism that gets its energy by breaking down dead material, dead producers and consumers (fallen leaves or animal remains. Bacteria/ fungi)
Tundra - found above 60N - winters very cold, summers are brief, little rainfall - layer of permafrost - no trees, mosses, grasses, low shrubs
Grassland - Savannah grassland found between tropics, dry and wet seasons - mostly grass, few scattered trees
Temperate grasslands - higher latitudes, more variation in temperature - less rainfall - Only grass
Temperate deciduos rainforest - mid-latitudes

### Coasts
4 Processes of Erosion (coasts & rivers):
1) Hydraulic action - the sheer impact of waves, and traps air in cracks, increasing pressure on rock
2) Abrasion - the waves carry rock that get thrown into the cliff face, breaking away rock
3) Attrition - particles carried by the waves break down as they collide with each other
4) Solution - soft rocks dissolving in the seawater
Fetch - length of water over which the wind has blown
Rock arrangement
Mechanical weathering - breakdown of rocks without any chemical change (freeze-thaw, onion-skin)
Chemical weathering - breakdown of rocks with the mineral composition being changed
Biological weathering - breakdown of rocks caused by nature
Swash - power of wave moving up the beach
Backwash - power of wave going down the beach back to the sea
Constructive wave - smaller, gentler waves - strong swash, weak backwash
Destructive wave - bigger waves - weak swash, strong backwash
Wave-cut notch - notch formed from the base of the cliff being eroded
Headland - hard rock that juts out to sea
Bay - a crescent shaped indentation on a coastline - usually a beach
4 methods of material transportation:
1) Traction - large boulders pushed along water bed
2) Saltation - hopping or bouncing pebbles, too heavy to be suspensed
3) Suspension - rocks carried within the water
4) Solution - dissolved rock carried in the water
Longshore drift - the movement that the waves carry rocks/beach amterial in correlation to prevailing wind
Estuary - end of the river
Scarp - steep cut in side of a slope
Deposition - dropping off of material, how beaches build up
Groynes - wooden/stone fences built adjacent to coast, trap material from Longshore drift
Discordant coastline - coast made up of alternating bands of hard and soft rock vertially, at right angles to the coast.
Concordant coastline - coast made up of alternating bands of hard and soft rock horizontally, parallel to coast
Bar - spit that joins two headlands together.
Lagoon - little pool in the middle of a bar

### Rivers
Upper course - steep gradient - V-shaped valley - narrow, shallow channel - Waterfalls, gorges, interlocking spurs
Middle course - medium gradient - gently sloping valley sides - Wider, deeper channel
Lower course - Gentle gradient - Very wide, almost flat valley, Very wide and deep channel 
Source - start of the river
Vertical erosion - deepens river valley and channel - dominant in upper course
Lateral erosion - widens river valley and channel - during formation of meanders - dominant in middle & lower course.
4 Processes of Erosion (coasts & rivers):
- Hydraulic action - force of water colliding with rocks, traps air particles - puts pressure on rock, breaking rocks
- Abrasion - eroded rocks in river scrape against channel, wearing it away. Most common type of erosion(rivers)
- Attrition - eroded rocks in river crash into each other, break into smaller pieces. Particle size decreases along river
- Solution - river water dissolves soft rocks (e.g chalk, limestone)
4 methods of material transportation:
- Traction - large boulders pushed along water bed
- Saltation - hopping or bouncing pebbles, too heavy to be suspensed
- Suspension - rocks carried within the water
- Solution - dissolved rock carried in the water
Deposition - river drops material when it loses its velocity/energy - dominant in lower course - happens if there is less water, more eroded material, water is shallower, or when river reaches the mouth
##### Landforms
Waterfalls - upper course - area of soft rock eroded after hard rock, creates a 'step', then a steep drop
Plunge pool - hard rock eventually undercut by erosion, unsupported and collapses - Collapsed rock swirls at bottom and erodes soft rock by abrasion, creating a plunge pool
Gorge - Waterfall when over time more undercutting happens and waterfall retreats, leaving hard rock sticking out
Interlocking spurs - upper course - rivers cant laterally erode, winds around high hillsides that interlock with each other

Meanders - middle course - large bends in river - current is faster on outside bend as channel is deeper, erosion happens - slower on inside bend, material deposited - forms slip-off slopes
Thalweg - fastest flow of river - on outside bends
Ox-bow lakes -  U-shaped meander - river breaks through neck - river flows along shortest course - deposition cuts off meander - an ox-bow is formed

Flood plains - flat, wide valley area of land on sides of river - deposites material when flooded, builds up flood plain
Levees - natural embankments along edges of river channel - during flood, heaviest material deposited closest to river, builds  up and creates levees on edges.
Estuaries - found at mouth - tidal area - floods deposit silt & sand & form mudflats. Mudflats exposed at low tide.
