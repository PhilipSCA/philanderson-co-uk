## COLD WAR
Grand alliance - 1941 - Soviet union, USA and Britain - joined to win and end the war
Tehran conference - 1943 - D-day - USA and Britain invade France on a second front in 1944, USSR join war after Nazis defeated
Yalta - Feb 1945 - Agreed to: 
1) split Germany into 4 zones(France, Britain, USA, USSR each a zone)
2) force Germany to pay reparations
3) set up the United Nations
4) Free elections in eastern european countries liberated from Nazi control
Disagreements over how Poland should be run. - made it clear that agreements on eastern europe would be difficult.
Potsdam - July 1945 - Agreed to:
1) Divide Germany and Berlin into 4 zones
2) Let the power in each zone take reparations in kind from its zone
Stalin made Poland's government pro-communist - Truman and Churchill concerned Stalin wasnt going to allow free elections as agreed in Yalta.
Stalin insisted Germany pay Soviet higher reparations to compensate for losses during war, but other members of Alliance refused.
Capitalism - ideal-everyone free to invest money to own land, businesses and property. Can keep any profits they make - democracy - hierarchy
Communism - ideal-all land, businesses owned by state and profits made used for good of all. No individual profit-making - Elections from same party, all citizens equal.
Long Telegram - 1946 - George Kennan - Soviet Union heavily armed, wanted to destroy capitalism. USSR threat to world peace, USA needed strong action
Novikov telegram - 1946 - Nikolai Novikov - USA wanted to take over world, even if they had to go to war with USSR to destroy communism.
Satellite state - countries controlled or under the influence of USSR - many people unhappy in these countries but faced oppression if objected.
Iron curtain - 'metaphor' - border between pro-capitalist European countries in West and pro-communist countries in the East.

Sat History lesson:
 
Potsdam:
1) Mistrust of Stalin greater - had just arrested 16 non-communist polish leaders
2) Stalin wanted double reparations agreed | West wanted Germany to recover

Soviet Takeovers:
Why:
- Russia attacked twice in a generation by Germany
- 25m Soviet deaths in WW2
- Wanted a buffer zone of friendly countries - security after Germany attacks(1914, 1941)

I partially agree with Interpretation 2  as it says the fear of Germany and the opportunity to create a buffer zone were the most important features in the Soviet takeovers. I agree as I know that Stalin wanted a 'sphere of influence' around the Soviet Union, after being attacked twice in a generation by Germany. So clearly this evidence supports Interpretation 2 that the key features were defensive and opportunistic because Russia wanted more security..

Interpretation 1 challenges Interpretation 2. It suggests that how the Soviet takeovers took place was the key feature, with rigged elections, arrests and assassinations. I agree as I know that in 1945, 16 non-communist polish leaders were arrested. Soviets also rigged elections like in Romania where communists won 70% of the vote. So clearly this evidence supports Interpretation 1 that the key feature of the Soviet takeovers was the negative consequences because it contributed to the Cold War rivalry and division of Europe.
