### Weaknesses of Weimar constitution
Germany - republic - nationalists unhappy

2) Article 48 - president power to act without parliaments approval, in emergency - power overused - weakened confidence in democracy - Hitler used in Reichstag fire - 4,000 locked up
3) Same people in charge of army and courts - Generals and judges had served Kaiser - opposed new system - ex-soldiers assassinated opponents, biased judges didnt punish as much - encouraged 356 assassinations 1918-23 - undermining stability, from 1920-23, extreme nationalists tried to take control, but failed.

Ruhr - Jan 1923 - 60,000 French & belgium troops invaded - took coal and timber - 130 died resisting, humiliation - led to hyperinflation
Hyperinflation - workers on strike(passive resistance) - not mine coal for French - Government printed more money - loaf of bread, 250 marks to 200 billion - wheelbarrows for wallets, food shortages, rise in crime
Munich Putsch - 8/9th Nov 1923 - 600 SA leaders burst into a beer hall meeting - forced leaders to rebel. 9th Nov - Hitler + 2000 SA members + Ludendorff into Munich - police and army reinforcements there - 16 SA killed - Hitler arrested - made speeches over 24 days attacking government.

## COLD WAR
Grand alliance - 1941 - Soviet union, USA and Britain - joined to win and end the war
Tehran conference - 1943 - D-day - USA and Britain invade France on a second front in 1944, USSR join war after Nazis defeated
Yalta - Feb 1945 - Agreed to: 
1) split Germany into 4 zones(France, Britain, USA, USSR each a zone)
2) force Germany to pay reparations
3) set up the United Nations
4) Free elections in eastern european countries liberated from Nazi control
Disagreements over how Poland should be run. - made it clear that agreements on eastern europe would be difficult.
Potsdam - July 1945 - Agreed to:
   1) Divide Germany and Berlin into 4 zones
   2) Let the power in each zone take reparations in kind from its zone
   - Truman & Churchill concerned Stalin wasnt going to allow free elections as agreed in Yalta - Stalin arrested 16 non-communist polish leaders - Poland pro-communist
  - Stalin insisted double reparations to compensate for losses during war, but West refused - wanted Germany to recover
Capitalism - ideal-everyone free to invest money to own land, businesses and property. Can keep any profits they make - democracy - hierarchy
Communism - ideal-all land, businesses owned by state and profits made used for good of all. No individual profit-making - Elections from same party, all citizens equal.
Long Telegram - 1946 - George Kennan - Soviet Union heavily armed, wanted to destroy capitalism. USSR threat to world peace, USA needed strong action
Novikov telegram - 1946 - Nikolai Novikov - USA wanted to take over world, even if they had to go to war with USSR to destroy communism.
Satellite state - countries controlled or under the influence of USSR - many people unhappy in these countries but faced oppression if objected.
Iron curtain - 'metaphor' - border between pro-capitalist European countries in West and pro-communist countries in the East.
#### Soviet takeovers 1945-48
Why: Stalin wanted security - Germany attacked twice - 25m Soviets dead in WW2 - wanted a buffer of friendly countries - helped communists seize power in E.Europe
How: SALAMI TACTICS - Red Army(Soviet) soldiers in charge of E.europe after pushing Nazis out of places - arrested opponents e.g leader of Small Holders Party - Hungary, rigged elections - Romania won 70%, 16 non-communist Poles arrested,
Consequence: Soviets more secure - 'buffer zone' between West
   - forces US 'containment' policy - Truman Doctrine, Marshall plan 
   - Soviets respond with Cominform & Comecon - Cold war rivalry & division deepens.
Truman Doctrine - 1947 - promised aid to any country threatened by communism - Greece & Turkey $400m - increased tension, rivalry deepened
Marshall Plan - 1947 - George Marshall advised - $12bn in aid to European countries - recover economy after war - won 16 countries over to capitalism - trade w USA increases
Cominform - 1947 - USSR direct response to Marshall plan - put all European communist parties under their control, attempt to create trade network, prevent trading with West. Any communists with different views pushed out of parties. Published newspaper - ideals
Comecon - 1949 - centralise planning of industry & agriculture in East - promised financial aid - keep countries loyal (Molotov plan) - called Marshall plan 'Dollar Imperialism', banned countries(It+Fr) from accepting Marshall aid - encouraged trade and specialise in certain areas: Hungary=food, E.Germany=industry(coal and steel)

Trizonia - 1948 - USA, Britain, France
Berlin blockade - June 1948 - W.Berlin was capitalist advert in communist area - Stalin blocked all land routes to Berlin for Trizonia, hoping withdrawal from West Berlin - led to NATO & Warsaw Pact - CW tension greatly increased
  - Consequences: Negotiations of agreed future of Germany gone, Germany divided-East&West
  - NATO created to prevent soviet expansions - heightened tensions - shows wasr between USA and USSR was distinct possibility - Led to Warsaw Pact 1955
Berlin airlift - Trizonia flew supplies to W.Berlin 4000 tonnes a day, lasted for 11 months, cost $224m. On May 1949 - land blockade lifted
Warsaw Pact - 1955 - Response to W.Germany joining NATO - 8 countries - Soviet generals in charge of each country. Consequence: Greater Soviet control - pact troops used in Hungary&Czeckslovakia crisis

#### Arms race 1945-60
1949-53 - US increased military spending by $30bn \\ USSR by $10bn.
1945 - USA - atomic bomb - Hiroshima,Nagisaki \\ USSR - 1949 - atomic bomb
1952 - USA - first hydrogen bomb - 1000x powerful \\ 1953 - USSR tests own H bomb
1957 - USSR - first ICBM \\ 1959 - USA - submarines capable of launching nuclear weapons at coast of USSR
1961 - USSR - Tsar Bomb - most powerful H bomb ever created.
1968 - USA - missile that can hit multiple targets \\ USSR - technology to shoot down incoming missiles 

#### Hungarian Uprising 1956
Why: - Khrushchev 'Secret speech' - criticise Stalin - raised hope for change
- Poland & Austria given more freedom, less soviet control - Hungarians inspired
- Rakosi - hardline Stalinist - brutal secret police, 2,000 killed, 200,000 imprisoned since 1947
  - Living standards fell - Fuel, food shortages - Hungarians began to protest - 'uprising' began
What: October - Khr. sent in tanks to stop protests/restore order - 12 killed, hundreds wounded
- Former PM Imre Nagy returned - more popular - tanks withdrawn
- Nagy - announced reforms = free press, speech, elections - then said Hungary would leave Warsaw Pact
- Khr. under pressure to act from other communist countries 
    - 200,000 troops, 6,000 tanks - 3,000 killed & 200,000 refugees fled - Nagy sent to Romania, executed
Consequence: 1) Strengthened control & Khr. power. Clear Warning to all satellite states to not try anything
2) USA - saw this as confirming aggressive & brutal nature of communism. Khr. shown how brutal he could be - crushed hopes of a 'thaw' in relations
3) Britain - took 20,000 refugees. Time magazine named Hungary freedom fighter 'Man of the Year' - CW rivalry deepened - both sides saw the worst of each other

#### Berlin Crisis 1958-63 | Berlin Wall & Summits
Why:
  - Khr. calls W.Berlin a 'fishbone stuck in our throat'
  - 100,000 refugees fled from East Germany through W.Berlin 1955-60
  - ‘Brain drain’ - East Germany lost 3m(15-20%) of population - engineers, teachers, professors
  - Khr. embarrassed - worried W.Germany stronger, E.Germany weaker - issues 6 month ultimatum
What: 4 Summits:
  1) Geneva - Khrushchev & Eisenhower - no agreement, reduces tensions, Khrushchev visits USA
  2) USA - Camp David - Kh. in USA demonstrates better relations - no deal, agree to meet again in Paris - Khr. removes 6 month ultimatum
  3) Paris - 1960 - U2 spy plane shot down over Soviet territory - 2 weeks prior. Eisen refuses to apologise - Khr. furious & storms out - Failure, tensions rose
  4) Vienna - 1961 - Khr. reissues 6 month ultimatum - new President JFK takes tough line - after embarrassment of Bay of Pigs, fear of behind Soviets in space race - JFK rejects ultimatum - $3.5b increase on defence spending
Consequences:
  - Berlin Wall - Aug 1961 - Khr. starts barbed wire fence and wall - division solid - Checkpoint Charlie tensions - tanks face off, backchannels used - Soviets back tanks away then US - 170 died 1961-89 trying to cross
  - JFK visits W.berlin - Berlin wall symbol of division in world - propaganda success for West
  - stabilised relations - berlin less source of tension
  - stopped refugee crisis - stabilised E.Germany - JFK 'a wall is better than a war'

#### Cuba Crisis & Cuba missile crisis
1959 - Castro overthrows Batista - US worried - Castro took control of US businesses in cuba - USA banned sugar imports to cuba - 90% of their trade - USSR offered help - sent economic, military, technical aid - Khr. wanted ally close to USA
Bay of Pigs - 1961 - CIA trained cuban exiles - sent 1,400 to invade cuba - massive failure - within two days, 1,100 exiles captured & ransomed to USA in exchange for $53m of food, medicine.
  - made Kennedy look weak & indecisive - strengthened USAs belief in need for containment
  - USSR & Cuba developed closer ties - USSR gave military suppport to Cuba to threaten USA

Cuban Missile Crisis:
- Khr. building missile base in Cuba to: protect Cuba, retaliate against US missiles in Turkey pointed at USSR, show his strength to rest of world - US found out on 16th October 1962 - he wanted to act but didnt want to start world war.
- '13 Days' on brink of nuclear war: 16-21 Oct - JFK set up ExComm to discuss action - wanted to appear strong - placed a naval blockade around Cuba to prevent Soviet ships docking - 18 SU ships turned around
  - 22nd: JFK made televised address to US about missiles in Cuba & blockade
  - 23-24: Khr. told Kennedy his ships would break through blockade - soviet ships turned back at blockade
  - 25th: US spy planes reported increased building work at missile site in Cuba
  - 26th: Kennedy recieves telegram - Khr. promised to remove launch sites if USA didnt invade Cuba
  - 27th: second telegram - launch sites removed only if turkey missiles removed - JFK couldn't openly agree as NATO allies would object - said he wouldn't invade Cuba - secretly agreed to remove missiles in turkey. 28th: Khr. removes Cuba missiles
Consequences: Kennedy - showed he was a strong leader who prevented USSR from delivering warheads to Cuba
- Khrushchev - saved Cuba from American invasion - protected communism - forced USA to remove Turkey missiles
- Hotline - direct line between White House & Kremlin - leaders could talk immediately - leaders aware of how close they were to war & prepared to co-operate to avoid it again - relaxed tensions 
- hotline - led to Test Ban Treaty, Non-proliferation treaty & Detente

#### Czechslovakian crisis


Sat History lesson:

Soviet Takeovers:
Why:
- Russia attacked twice in a generation by Germany
- 25m Soviet deaths in WW2
- Wanted a buffer zone of friendly countries - security after Germany attacks(1914, 1941)

I partially agree with Interpretation 2  as it says the fear of Germany and the opportunity to create a buffer zone were the most important features in the Soviet takeovers. I agree as I know that Stalin wanted a 'sphere of influence' around the Soviet Union, after being attacked twice in a generation by Germany. So clearly this evidence supports Interpretation 2 that the key features were defensive and opportunistic because Russia wanted more security..

Interpretation 1 challenges Interpretation 2. It suggests that how the Soviet takeovers took place was the key feature, with rigged elections, arrests and assassinations. I agree as I know that in 1945, 16 non-communist polish leaders were arrested. Soviets also rigged elections like in Romania where communists won 70% of the vote. So clearly this evidence supports Interpretation 1 that the key feature of the Soviet takeovers was the negative consequences because it contributed to the Cold War rivalry and division of Europe.
