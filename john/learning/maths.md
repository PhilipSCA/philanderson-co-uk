# Maths
```
Gradient - change in y/change in x = y2-y1/x2-x1
Speed = distance/time
Acceleration = change in velocity/time
Midpoint of a line = (x1 + x2/2 , y1 + y2/2)
Area of a trapezium = 1/2 (a+b) x height
Volume of any prism = length x Cross-section area
Cross-section area = width x height
```

## Probability
```
Mutually exclusive - events that can't happen at the same time
Exhaustive events - all the outcomes are included - P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
Independant events - the outcome doesnt depend on the other - P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)
Dependant events - when one outcome depends on the other
A' - complement a - NOT a
A n B - intercept - a AND b - middle of venn diagram
A u B - union - A or B - both circles
```
## Proportion & Compound measures
```
Direct proportion - when one value increase with the other - y = Kx
Inverse proportion - when one value increases as the other decreases - y = K/x
Constant of proportionality - represented as 'k' - the relation between two proportional numbers
