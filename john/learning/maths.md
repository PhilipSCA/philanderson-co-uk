# Maths
```
Gradient - change in y/change in x = y2-y1/x2-x1
Speed = distance/time
Acceleration = change in velocity/time
Midpoint of a line = (x1 + x2/2 , y1 + y2/2)
Area of a trapezium = 1/2 (a+b) x height
Volume of any prism = length x Cross-section area
Cross-section area = width x height

Permutations - combinations or different arrangements
Binomial - expression that has two terms
Coefficient - number before variable in expression (no equals)
Hyperbola - curve in graph
Relative freq. - probabilities based on results
Invariant - points that don't change after transformation
Equidistant - same distance
Elevation - 2d view of 3d solid, viewed from front or side
Frequency polygon - graph joining midpoints of data groups
Geometric sequence - each term is product of previous term and constant(r) - an = a1 (r)^n-1
Arithmetic - numbers with a common difference
Completing square - quadratic in form: (x + b/2)^2 + (b/2)^2 + c
Turning point - (x+a)2 + b (completed square) in form: (-a, b) (Maximum = if a is negative in quadratic)
Continous data - can take any value within range
Discrete data - only take certain values in given range (e.g goals scored)
Cosine rule - a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc x cos(a)
            - Cos(A) = b2+c2 - a2 / 2bc
Arc - section of circumference circle
Bisector - line that divided line exactly in half

```

## Probability
```
Mutually exclusive - events that can't happen at the same time
Exhaustive events - all the outcomes are included - P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
Independant events - the outcome doesnt depend on the other - P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)
Dependant events - when one outcome depends on the other
A' - complement a - NOT a
A n B - intercept - a AND b - middle of venn diagram
A u B - union - A or B - both circles
```
## Proportion & Compound measures
```
Direct proportion - when one value increase with the other - y = Kx
Inverse proportion - when one value increases as the other decreases - y = K/x
Constant of proportionality - represented as 'k' - the relation between two proportional numbers
