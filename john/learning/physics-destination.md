Thermal conductivity - measure of how well material conducts energy when heated (W/m/oC). High thermal conductivity = heats quick = energy transfer fast
Repel - objects with same charge push away from each other
Insulator - doesn't allow heat to pass through - traps heat, doesnt release
Conductor - allows heat/electricity to pass through easily - metals
Mass - amount of 'matter' in an object (kg)
Weight - gravity acting on object - W = m x g (N) - changes with gravity
Centre of mass - centre of an objects weight - where gravity affects
Uniform object - same density throughout - a regular shape
Free body diagram - shows all forces on an object - arrows show magnitude & direction
Resultant force - overall force acting on object
Equilibrium - when resultant force is 0
Stretching, compressing, bending - transfers energy
Moment - act about a point - turning effect of a force - Fd
System - single/group of objects that you're looking into
Closed system - system where no matter or energy can enter or leave
Limit of proportionality - point where extension is no longer proportional with force
Power - rate of doing work/ rate of energy transfer - Watts
Watts - joules of energy transferred per second

Radioactivity:
Alpha particle - 2 protons, 2 neutrons (He) - 5cm in air - highly ionising(charge of +2) - stopped by paper
Beta - fast electron - 1m in air - moderately ionising(charge -1) - stopped by aluminium/metal foil
Gamma - EM wave - infinite distance - low ionising(no charge) - stopped by thick lead or metres of concrete
Radioactive decay - unstable nuclei emitting radiation to become stable
Activity - rate of decay(Becquerels(Bq)) - short half-life = high activity
Half-life - time it takes for amount of radioactive nuclei to halve|| time for activity to halve
