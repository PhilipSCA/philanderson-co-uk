Repel - two objects with the same charge push away from each other
Insulator - material that doesn't allow heat to pass through - traps heat
Conductor - material that allows heat/electricity to pass through - metals
Geothermal - heated from Earth/ground
Mass - amount of 'matter' in an object - Same value anywhere in universe (kg)
Weight - gravity acting on an object - m x g - (N) - changes depending on gravity
Centre of mass - the centre of an object's weight - where gravity affects
Uniform object - same density throughout and is a regular shape
Free body diagram - shows all forces acting on an object. Arrows show magnitude and direction
Resultant force - (overall force) - overall force acting on an object
Equilibrium - when all forces on an object give a resultant force of 0 
Stretching, compressing, bending transfers energy
Moment - turning effect of a force


8 energy stores:
- Kinetic energy - movement energy store - depends on mass and speed
- Gravitational Potential energy - energy stored in height of an object in a gravitational field
- Elastic potential energy - energy stored in how stretched or squashed an object is
- Thermal energy - heat energy
- Chemical energy
- Magnetic energy
- Electrostatic energy
- Nuclear energy
Energy transferred: 
1) Mechanically - (force doing work),
2) electrically - (work done by moving charges), 
3) heating
4) radiation - (light/sound)
System - a single or group of objects that you're looking into
Closed system - systems where neither matter nor energy can enter or leave - net change in total energy is always 0
Limit of proportionality - point where extension is no longer proportional with force
Specific heat capacity - energy needed to raise 1kg of an object by 1 degree. (J/kg.C)
Conservation of energy - energy can be transferred, stored or dissipated, but cant be created or destroyed
Power - rate of doing work, rate of energy transfer - Watts
Watts - joules of energy transferred per second

### P6 - Radioactivity
Alpha particle - 2 protons, 2 neutrons (helium nucleus) - travels 5cm in air - highly ionising(charge of +2) - stopped by paper 
Beta particle - 1 fast electron - travels 1m in air - midly ionising(charge of -1) - stopped by aluminium/metal foil
Gamma wave - electromagnetic wave - infinite distance - low ionising, no charge - stopped by thick lead or metres of concrete
Radioactive decay - unstable nuclei emitting a type of radiation to become stable
Alpha decay - atoms have very large nuclei - unstable - have to release alpha particles
Beta decay - small atoms have too few protons compared to neutrons - unstable - have to release electrons - turns neutrons into protons
Ionise - to charge atoms
Activity - rate of decay - Becquerels(Bq) - short half-life means high rate of activity
Irradiation - being exposed to radiation, doesnt become radioactive
Contaminated - radioactive atoms are on/in that object - can be dangerous if radioactivity gets inside your body
Geiger counter - method to measure activity - counts
Half-life - time it takes for the amount of radioactive nuclei to halve - (time for activity to halve)
Isotope - element with same protons but different neutrons
Alpha decay equation = original element --> (mass number -4, atomic number -2) + 4,2 He
Beta decay equation = original element --> (mass number same, atomic number +1) + 0,-1 e
Uses of radiation:
Gamma - Medical tracers - able to track gamma rays in body 
Gamma - Radiotherapy - cancer treatment - gamma rays fired at mutated cells, kills them and other cells, heals in the end
Fission - type of nuclear reaction - releases gamma/kinetic energy from large, unstable atoms by splitting them - neutron hit & absorbed by nucleus, atom split into 2 lighter elements - shoots out more neutrons to start a chain reaction
Fusion - opposity - two light nuclei collide at high speed, fuse to create a larger, heavier nucleus | mass of big nucleus is smaller than two smaller nuclei - some mass converted to energy | releases more energy than fission

### P10
Acceleration due to gravity - freefalling acceleration - 9.81m/s2 (10m/s2)
Air resistance - frictional force with air - slows a falling object - increases as speed of object increases
Terminal velocity - the fastest an object can fall - when the air resistance is equal to the weight of an object, the object stops accelerating - it is at a constant 'terminal' velocity
Momentum = mass x velocity (p = mv)
Conservation of momentum - momentum is not created or destroyed in a closed system
Stopping distance - time it takes for a car to stop in an emergency = thinking distance + braking distance
Thinking distance - distance car travels between their reaction time = speed x reaction time
Braking distance - distance car travels between applying brake and it stops
Factors affecting reaction time - 1) Drugs/Alcohol, 2) Distractions, 3) Tiredness
Factors affecting braking distance - 1) Car's brakes or tyres, 2) car speed, 3) road conditions
Work done, when braking = inital kinetic energy = 1/2 mass x velocity^2 (Work = force x distance)
Force needed to stop car = 1/2 mv2 / distance
Force = momentum change / time
Inertia - how difficult it is to change an object's motion - high mass = high inertia

###
Waves - transfer energy through a medium without transferring any matter
Transerve waves - vibrations(up, down) perpendicular to direction of energy transfer(forward) - all EM waves, ripples/waves in water, waves on a string
Longitudinal waves - oscillations/vibrations parallel to direction of energy transfer(forward) - Sound waves in air eg ultrasound, Shock waves - Compressions & rarefractions
Wave speed - speed energy is being transferred = Frequency x wavelength
