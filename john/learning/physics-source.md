## P4 - Electricity & Circuits
I = Current - Amps(A)
Q = Charge - Coloumbs(C) - current x time
Milliamps - mA - 1/1000 of an Amp
Potential difference - energy transferred per unit of charge - Volts - energy/charge
Resistance - ability to slow current - Ohms
Diode - only allows current to flow in one direction - very high resistance in other direction
Resistor - limits passage of current - current proportional with P.d - resistance does not change
Variable resistor - able to change amount of resistance e.g with a slider
LED - Light-emitting diode - a diode that emits light
Lamp - current heats filament in bulb so it gives out light - resistance increases as temperature increases
Thermistor - resistance inversely proportional to temperature - as temp increases, resistance decreases - thermostats, heat-detected fire alarms
LDR - Light-dependent resistor - resistance inversely proportional to light intensity - as light increases, resistance decreases
Fuse - Resistor that melts if current gets too high
Cell - half a battery - provides P.d and energy
Battery - multiple cells joined in series - uses chemical energy to produce electricity - more voltage
Series Circuit:
- Current only has one route
- Current SAME all way round. (I1 = I2 = I3) 
- Potential difference is Shared (V = V1 + V2 + V3)
- Resistance is added together
Parallel Circuit:
- Current has more than one route
- Current shared through each branch. (I = I1+I2+I3)
- Potential difference SAME all way round (V1 = V2 = V3)
- Total resistance is lower than smallest single resistor
Practical - factors that affect resistance:
1) Connect crocodile clips to resistance wire of a certain circuit, 100cm apart.
2) Record amps and volts 
3) Move crocodile clips 10cm closer (to 90cm) and record new amps and volts
4) Repeats steps and use results to calculate resistance at each length. Plot a graph/table of this information
 - Safety measure: do not touch resistance wire whilst circuit is connected - extremely hot

## P5 - Electricity in the Home
ac - alternating current - potential difference can change(alternate) from negative to positive - found in mains
dc - Direct current - constant P.d - found in batteries & circuits
UK mains - AC supply of 230V and frequency of 50Hz
Power(P) - Energy transferred per second - Watts(W)
Energy - Power x time - also called work done
Energy transfer - Energy input --> Useful energy + wasted energy
National Grid - system of pylons, cables and transformers - transfers voltage to peoples homes
Step-up transformer - INCREASE P.d - less heat energy wasted (less current = less resistance) 
Step-down - Decrease P.d - more easily used
Live Wire - Brown - connects to fuse - Carries alternating potential difference from supply - About 230V
Neutral - Blue - completes circuit - 0V
Earth - Green & Yellow - Carries current safely to Earth if there is a fault - 0V
Plug - Made of plastic - good insulator - Earth wire at top left, Neutral - bottom left, Live - Mid right
Frequency - 1/Time period - Hertz(Hz) - number of times that ac reverses its direction per second
Power efficiency - Useful power output/Total power input x 100

## P6 - Density
Volume of an irregular object - dropping object in a liquid and measuring displacement - using an eureka can
irregular object density - weigh, find volume(eureka can) --> Density = m / v
Float - lower density
Sink - higher density
evaporate - any temperature
sublimation - solid to gas
solid - fixed lattice - strong forces - least energetic state of matter
liquid - particles random movement, in contact - more energy
gas - particles move randomly, far apart - weak attraction - most energetic

## P7 - Radioactivity
Alpha particle - 2 protons, 2 neutrons (helium nucleus) - travels 5cm in air - highly ionising(charge of +2) - stopped by paper 
Beta particle - 1 fast electron - travels 1m in air - midly ionising(charge of -1) - stopped by aluminium/metal foil
Gamma wave - electromagnetic wave - infinite distance - low ionising, no charge - stopped by thick lead or metres of concrete
Radioactive decay - unstable nuclei emitting a type of radiation to become stable
Alpha decay - atoms have very large nuclei - unstable - have to release alpha particles
Beta decay - small atoms have too few protons compared to neutrons - unstable - have to release electrons - turns neutrons into protons
Ionise - to charge atoms
Activity - rate of decay - Becquerels(Bq) - short half-life means high rate of activity
Irradiation - being exposed to radiation, doesnt become radioactive
Contaminated - radioactive atoms are on/in that object - can be dangerous if radioactivity gets inside your body
Geiger counter - method to measure activity - counts
Half-life - time it takes for the amount of radioactive nuclei to halve - (time for activity to halve)
Isotope - element with same protons but different neutrons
Alpha decay equation = original element --> (mass number -4, atomic number -2) + 4,2 He
Beta decay equation = original element --> (mass number same, atomic number +1) + 0,-1 e
Uses of radiation:
Gamma - Medical tracers - able to track gamma rays in body 
Gamma - Radiotherapy - cancer treatment - gamma rays fired at mutated cells, kills them and other cells, heals in the end
Fission - type of nuclear reaction - releases gamma/kinetic energy from large, unstable atoms by splitting them - neutron hit & absorbed by nucleus, atom split into 2 lighter elements - shoots out more neutrons to start a chain reaction
Fusion - opposity - two light nuclei collide at high speed, fuse to create a larger, heavier nucleus | mass of big nucleus is smaller than two smaller nuclei - some mass converted to energy | releases more energy than fission

## P10
Acceleration due to gravity - freefalling acceleration - 9.81m/s2 (10m/s2)
Air resistance - frictional force with air - slows a falling object - increases as speed of object increases
Terminal velocity - the fastest an object can fall - when the air resistance is equal to the weight of an object, the object stops accelerating - it is at a constant 'terminal' velocity
Momentum = mass x velocity (p = mv)
Conservation of momentum - momentum is not created or destroyed in a closed system
Stopping distance - time it takes for a car to stop in an emergency = thinking distance + braking distance
Thinking distance - distance car travels between their reaction time = speed x reaction time
Braking distance - distance car travels between applying brake and it stops
Factors affecting reaction time - 1) Drugs/Alcohol, 2) Distractions, 3) Tiredness
Factors affecting braking distance - 1) Car's brakes or tyres, 2) car speed, 3) road conditions
Work done, when braking = inital kinetic energy = 1/2 mass x velocity^2 (Work = force x distance)
Force needed to stop car = 1/2 mv2 / distance
Force = momentum change / time
Inertia - how difficult it is to change an object's motion - high mass = high inertia

##
Waves - transfer energy through a medium without transferring any matter
Transerve waves - vibrations(up, down) perpendicular to direction of energy transfer(forward) - all EM waves, ripples/waves in water, waves on a string
Longitudinal waves - oscillations/vibrations parallel to direction of energy transfer(forward) - Sound waves in air eg ultrasound, Shock waves - Compressions & rarefractions
Wave speed - speed energy is being transferred = Frequency x wavelength
