Repel - two objects with the same charge push away from each other
Insulator - material that doesn't allow heat to pass through - traps heat
Conductor - material that allows heat/electricity to pass through - metals
Geothermal - heated from Earth/ground
Mass - amount of 'matter' in an object - Same value anywhere in universe (kg)
Weight - gravity acting on an object - m x g - (N) - changes depending on gravity
Centre of mass - the centre of an object's weight - where gravity affects
Uniform object - same density throughout and is a regular shape
Free body diagram - shows all forces acting on an object. Arrows show magnitude and direction
Resultant force - (overall force) - overall force acting on an object
Equilibrium - when all forces on an object give a resultant force of 0 
Stretching, compressing, bending transfers energy
Moment - turning effect of a force

8 energy stores:
- Kinetic energy - movement energy store - depends on mass and speed
- Gravitational Potential energy - energy stored in height of an object in a gravitational field
- Elastic potential energy - energy stored in how stretched or squashed an object is
- Thermal energy - heat energy
- Chemical energy
- Magnetic energy
- Electrostatic energy
- Nuclear energy
Energy transferred: 
1) Mechanically - (force doing work),
2) electrically - (work done by moving charges), 
3) heating
4) radiation - (light/sound)
System - a single or group of objects that you're looking into
Closed system - systems where neither matter nor energy can enter or leave - net change in total energy is always 0
Limit of proportionality - point where extension is no longer proportional with force
Specific heat capacity - energy needed to raise 1kg of an object by 1 degree. (J/kg.C)
Conservation of energy - energy can be transferred, stored or dissipated, but cant be created or destroyed
Power - rate of doing work, rate of energy transfer - Watts
Watts - joules of energy transferred per second
