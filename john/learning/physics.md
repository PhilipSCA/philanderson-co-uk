**Physics - The study of forces, the laws of forces and space. One of the three subjects in
Science**

Motion - the act or vibration of movement, which can be seen.
Gas - one of the three states of matter, which you cannot touch and the particles are very
spread out.Gas travels through the air.
Joule - this is the unit of measurement for energy and its equal to 1 watt-second
Momentum - the product of an object's mass and its velocity which makes things go 
further
or curve if you hit them with momentum. This can differ depending on how much force is
put on the object.
Influence - when a secondary substance affect other substances making it different 
from its original place or form
Variation- this is when a change is made. this especially happens in experiments when
trying to find different outcomes of something.
X-ray- when radiation of electromagnetic waves are scanned on your body to see 
through your skin and show your bones to see any broken bones or how badly it is broken.
Velocity = Speed
Resultant - the overall force of a point or object as a single force
Contract - to get smaller in size because of a force
Celestial - relating to the sky and outer space and is looked at in astronomy
Motion - the action or process of moving around and using your body
Light - what makes us see objects and not darkness. The sun emits light
Fusion - to merge and become one object
Elastic - it means that it can transform or share on bend back into its original 
form - if it can do that then this means it is elastically deformed
Inelastic - the opposite of elastic, it means if you bend, stretch or compress it,
 it will stay that until, bent again. If it cant return to its original shape.
Friction - when heat forms from 2 surfaces rubbing together and slows them down
Eclipse  - when the moon goes in front of sun and the light is blocked. 
This Happens once a year.
Neurons - type of measurement
Gravity - a force that pushes you down and keeps you on the ground
