Repel - two objects with the same charge push away from each other
Insulator - material that doesn't allow heat to pass through - traps heat
Conductor - material that allows heat/electricity to pass through - metals
Geothermal - heated from Earth/ground
Mass - amount of 'matter' in an object - Same value anywhere in universe (kg)
Weight - gravity acting on an object - m x g - (N) - changes depending on gravity
Centre of mass - the centre of an object's weight - where gravity affects
Uniform object - same density throughout and is a regular shape
Free body diagram - shows all forces acting on an object. Arrows show magnitude and direction
Resultant force - (overall force) - overall force acting on an object
Equilibrium - when all forces on an object give a resultant force of 0 
Stretching, compressing, bending transfers energy
Limit of proportionality - point where extension is no longer proportional with force
Moment - turning effect of a force
